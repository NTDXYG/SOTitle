"I 'm trying to do this . I have an enum of week days . I have used enum since weekdays are constantand I have a class , called Session . A session is simply what is going on at a particular time e.g . a maths classThere is a third class , called Venue . Venues host the sessions , e.g . the maths class can be from 9am to 10am , at a venue called `` maths-class '' ( an example ) What I need to do is this - create a list of sessions in the enum i.e . each day has its sessions , and then I need to hold the enums in a structure ( an ArrayList or enumset ? ) within a venue i.e . a venue has sessions from Monday to Friday ( ideally school classes ) . So it will be something like this : So that in the venue , we can have : And here are my questions : Can I nest the Session class within an enum ? Can an enum accept arraylists ? What is the best structure to hold the enums with their sessions inside the venue ? Any better ideas for this ? Someone just told me that I 'll be passing the same day to all venues regardless e.g . MONDAY is MONDAY for all venues , its list will be updated by every venue . So I think that 's the end of discussion even though nobody commented ."

"I 'm trying to implement PGP encryption based on Yubikey NEO OpenPGP Smart Card applet in a Java application .

"This is a followup to my question here : Android thread runnable performanceI 'm having some difficulty wrapping my head around synchronized methods for my appI 'm polling the sensors and storing the sensor values into arrays whenever they changeEvery 10ms , my app will take the current sensor values ( from the arrays ) and insert them into a database using a single thread executor . So the onSensorChanged method is both writing to the arrays , and reading from the arrays to write to databaseMy question is , should the onSensorChanged method be synchronized ? The most important thing is that I do n't miss any data . Every 10ms I need to store the current sensor values - none can be missed.So to my understanding , a synchronized method means that the UI thread will hold a lock , and it will write the sensor values to the arrays . During this time , the executor thread can not read from those arrays due to the lock . Then the lock is lifted and the executor thread then locks , reads from arrays , and write to database , releases lockI might be misunderstanding the use of synchronized methods here , especially given onSensorChanged is event driven and I 'm not sure how that plays into itBut it seems that in a situation like this , I might not be inserting the most recent values every 10ms . When the UI thread establishes a lock , the executor thread ca n't write those values to the database . By the time the executor thread can write , the values would now be a few ms old and inaccurateOn the other hand , synchronization would mean that I dont have situations where the UI thread is changing the array values , while at the same time the executor thread is insert half changed values into the databaseSo for this type of situation where I need to insert the most recent/accurate sensor data every 10ms , should I be using a synchronized method ?"

"I know that exoplayer has support for RTSP , but I need C++ code that works on players from lots of OSs , so I need to parse the RTP packet in C++ to NAL units before passing to exoplayerI found a way to decode RTP packets using live555 and extract its NAL units . According to ExoPlayer 's documentation : Components common to all ExoPlayer implementations are : A MediaSource that defines the media to be played , loads the media , and from which the loaded media can be read.A MediaSource isinjected via ExoPlayer.prepare at the start of playback . ... So I need a custom MediaSource that can extract NAL units from my C++ code.At the class reference for MediaSource we can see that there are already some MediaSources available . I though maybe SmoothStreaming MediaSource could work but there 's no description of what it does exactly and in its constructor I have to provide an Uri or an SsManifest ( what ) .I can see that there exists a NAL unit utility in this library so maybe things are already half doneSo how to build or use an already available MediaSource to read NAL units for ExoPlayer to play ? As an additinal , how would you pass the NAL units from C++ to Java ? In the code I found it 's simply storing them in a C++ buffer . Should I read this buffer in Java somehow ? UPDATE : I 've been researching how this library works . It all begins with a MediaSource which have objects like Extractor and DataSource . Seems that ExtractorMediaSource is a MediaSource where you can provide your own Extractor and DataSource.As I understood , DataSource is a class that gets the raw bytes from any possible place , be it a file read or a network packet . Based on the available Extractor classes on the library like Mp4Extractor and Mp3Extractor , an Extractor is something that will interpret the data read from DataSource . The two main methods from the Extractor interface are : I do n't know what are ExtractorInput and ExtractorInput for , but they look important.So somehow Extractor reads from DataSource , parses it and sends to Renderer in a common format ? I need to know how is this common format so I can parse the NAL units that I read from a custom DataSource ."

"I know the meaning of the strictfp modifier on methods ( and on classes ) , according to the JLS : JLS 8.4.3.5 , strictfp methods : The effect of the strictfp modifier is to make all float or double expressions within the method body be explicitly FP-strict ( §15.4 ) .JLS 15.4 FP-strict expressions : Within an FP-strict expression , all intermediate values must be elements of the float value set or the double value set , implying that the results of all FP-strict expressions must be those predicted by IEEE 754 arithmetic on operands represented using single and double formats . Within an expression that is not FP-strict , some leeway is granted for an implementation to use an extended exponent range to represent intermediate results ; the net effect , roughly speaking , is that a calculation might produce `` the correct answer '' in situations where exclusive use of the float value set or double value set might result in overflow or underflow.I 've been trying to come up with a way to get an actual difference between an expression in a strictfp method and one that is not strictfp . I 've tried this on two laptops , one with a Intel Core i3 CPU and one with an Intel Core i7 CPU . And I ca n't get any difference.A lot of posts suggest that native floating point , not using strictfp , could be using 80-bit floating point numbers , and have extra representable numbers below the smallest possible java double ( closest to zero ) or above the highest possible 64-bit java double.I tried this code below with and without a strictfp modifier and it gives exactly the same results.Actually , I assume that any difference would only show up when the code is compiled to assembly so I am running it with the -Xcomp JVM argument . But no difference.I found another post explaining how you can get the assembly code generated by HotSpot ( OpenJDK documentation ) . I 'm running my code with java -Xcomp -XX : +UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX : +PrintAssembly.The first expression ( v * 1.0000001 / 1.0000001 ) with the strictfp modifier , and also the same without it , is compiled to : There is nothing in that code that truncates the result of each step to 64 bits like I had expected . Looking up the documentation of movsd , mulsd and divsd , they all mention that these ( SSE ) instructions operate on 64-bit floating point values , not 80-bit values as I expected . So it seems logical that the double value-set that these instructions operate on is already the IEEE 754 value set , so there would be no difference between having strictfp and not having it.My questions are : Is this analysis correct ? I do n't use Intel assembly very often so I 'm not confident of my conclusion.Is there any ( other ) modern CPU architecture ( that has a JVM ) for which there is a difference between operation with and without the strictfp modifier ?"
"Sorry for the poor title , ca n't think of a succinct way of putting this..I 'm thinking of having a list of objects that will all be of a specific interface .

When doing lazy initialization of a static singleton in Java you can do this : Because the inner class SingletonWrapper is only loaded when first accessed the Bob ( ) is not created until getInstance ( ) is called.My question is whether there are any similar tricks that can be used to do a lazy instantiation of a member variable in a non-static context.Is there any way we can have an instance of Jane within Bob and thread safely have the instance only created on demand without using double check locking or AtomicReference . Ideally the get method should remain as simple as the one in these examples but if that is not possible then the simplest and fastest possible ( most efficient ) execution of the get method would be ideal .
"I 'm following the Java tutorial on Primitive Data Types .

Use the Integer class to use int data type as an unsigned integer.What I 'm understanding from this quote is that I can now store up to 2^32-1 as an int as long as I use the Integer wrapper object rather than the int primitive data type . But when I tried this out , my compiler is complaining that the value I 'm using is too large , 2^31 .

However , such query option specifications are still essentially defined as raw Strings in the code : Granted , I could use JAXB , JDOM , files or some other tool to create the XML , but my personal opinion is that we are still resorting to storing queries in resource files in the code , which is not a bad thing in itself , but without careful consideration could lead to code maintenance nightmares.Furthermore , the fact that these options need to be persisted via REST at the server introduces one more layer of potential problems in case this is mandatory since the options might need to be synchronized with every database instance that is meant to work with a code base.So , if the Marklogic devs are listening , I think the Java client API is n't as mature or documented as I expected it to be.I have two options so far:1 ) I could hardcode my XCC queries in String files and try to use parameter placeholders to insert the data that I need and retrieve via an XCC session . Or.2 ) See if there are any XSD files for the http : //marklogic.com/appservices/search namespace and create static JAXB objects from them in order to build some sort of `` criteria '' classes a la Hibernate or QueryDSL which , sadly I must say , already supports some level of MongoDB querying.Guys , really , bring some sort of fluent querying facilities like QueryDSL to Marklogic and get rid of this Rube Goldberg querying machine.Update 2 : Seems as if this might be addressed in ML7 .

And where is it specified in the documentation ? The toString javadoc does n't really help ( me at least ) .I do see this in the language spec : The elements of the types float and double are those values that can be represented using the IEEE 754 32-bit single-precision and 64-bit double-precision binary floating-point formats , respectively.Wikipedia 's IEEE 754 article gives this : This gives from 6 to 9 significant decimal digits precision ( if a decimal string with at most 6 significant decimal is converted to IEEE 754 single precision and then converted back to the same number of significant decimal , then the final string should match the original ; Question 2So it seems that this is just how Java/IEEE 754 floats are supposed to work ?

"When looking at the source code of java.lang.String of openjdk-1.6 , i saw that String.hashCode ( ) uses 31 as prime number and computes Now the reason for me to look at this was the question i had in mind whether comparing hashCodes in String.equals would make String.equals significantly faster . But looking at hashCode now , the following questions come to my mind : Would n't a bigger prime help avoid collisions better , at least for short strings , seeing that for example `` BC '' has the same hash as `` Ab '' ( since the ascii letters live in the region 65-122 , would n't a prime higher than that work better ) ? Is it a conscious decision to use 31 as prime , or just some random one that is used because it is common ? How likely is a hash collision , given a fixed String length ? where this question is heading is the original question how good comparing hashCodes and String length could already discern strings , to avoid comparing the actual contents.a little off-topic , maybe : Is there a good reason String.equals does not compare hashCodes as additional shortcut ? a little more off-topic : assuming we have two Strings with the same content , but different instances : is there any way to assert equality without actually comparing the contents ? I would guess not , since someway into String lengths , the space explodes into sizes where we will inevitably have collisions , but what about some restrictions - only a certain character set , a maximum string length ... and how much do we need to restrict the string space to be able to have such a hash function ?"

"There seem to be two different patterns : Pattern # 1The GenericFilterBean does the authenticating itself . As used by most of the out-of-the-box filters : UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter , DigestAuthenticationFilter , etc.request comes into filterfilter creates an Authentication with authenticated=falsefilter passes that to a specific AuthenticationProvider that it references directly ( sometimes via an AuthenticationManager ) if all goes well , they create a new type of Authentication and pass back to filterfilter puts that into the contextIn this pattern , the original Authentication is nothing more than a POJO to pass to the AuthenticationProvider - it never goes into the context.Also , more often than not , the filter also has a direct reference to a specific EntryPoint - which it calls at the end . ( I thought this pattern would suit pre-authentication filters ?

"So Java 9 is there , soon to be followed by Java 10 . Time we should make our libraries ready for use in Java 9 projects .

When I set targetCompatibility = 8 , an error message tells me to also set sourceCompatibility = 8 accordingly . Which then rejects the module-info.java for which I should set sourceCompatibility = 9.How can this be solved ?

"I 'm implementing an application which records and analyzes audio in real time ( or at least as close to real time as possible ) , using the JDK Version 8 Update 201 . While performing a test which simulates typical use cases of the application , I noticed that after several hours of recording audio continuously , a sudden delay of somewhere between one and two seconds was introduced . Up until this point there was no noticeable delay . It was only after this critical point of recording for several hours when this delay started to occur.What I 've tried so farTo check if my code for timing the recording of the audio samples is wrong , I commented out everything related to timing . This left me essentially with this update loop which fetches audio samples as soon as they are ready ( Note : Kotlin code ) : This is my read method : However , even without any timing from my side the problem was not resolved . Therefore , I went on to experiment a bit and let the application run using different audio formats , which lead to very confusing results ( I 'm going to use a PCM signed 16 bit stereo audio format with little endian and a sample rate of 44100.0 Hz as default , unless specified otherwise ) : The critical amount of time that has to pass before the delay appears seems to be different depending on the machine used . On my Windows 10 desktop PC it is somewhere between 6.5 and 7 hours . On my laptop ( also using Windows 10 ) however , it is somewhere between 4 and 5 hours for the same audio format.The amount of audio channels used seems to have an effect . If I change the amount of channels from stereo to mono , the time before the delay starts to appear is doubled to somewhere between 13 and 13.5 hours on my desktop.Decreasing the sample size from 16 bits to 8 bits also results in a doubling of the time before the delay starts to appear . Somewhere between 13 and 13.5 hours on my desktop.Changing the byte order from little endian to big endian has no effect.Switching from stereomix to a physical microphone has no effect either.I tried opening the line using different buffer sizes ( 1024 , 2048 and 3072 sample frames ) as well as its default buffer size . This also did n't change anything.Flushing the TargetDataLine after the delay has started to occur results in all bytes being zero for approximately one to two seconds . After this I get non-zero values again . The delay , however , is still there . If I flush the line before the critical point , I do n't get those zero-bytes.Stopping and restarting the TargetDataLine after the delay appeared also does not change anything.Closing and reopening the TargetDataLine , however , does get rid of the delay until it reappears after several hours from there on.Automatically flushing the TargetDataLines internal buffer every ten minutes does not help to resolve the issue . Therefore , a buffer overflow in the internal buffer does not seem to be the cause.Using a parallel garbage collector to avoid application freezes also does not help.The used sample rate seems to be important . If I double the sample rate to 88200 Hertz , the delay starts occurring somewhere between 3 and 3.5 hours of runtime.If I let it run under Linux using my `` default '' audio format , it still runs fine after about 9 hours of runtime.Conclusions that I 've drawn : These results let me come to the conclusion that the time for which I can record audio before this issue starts to happen is dependent on the machine on which the application is run and dependent on the byte rate ( i.e . frame size and sample rate ) of the audio format . This seems to hold true ( although I ca n't completely confirm this as of now ) because if I combine the changes made in 2 and 3 , I would assume that I can record audio samples for four times as long ( which would be somewhere between 26 and 27 hours ) as when using my `` default '' audio format before the delay starts to appear . As I did n't find the time to let the application run for this long yet , I can only tell that it did run fine for about 15 hours before I had to stop it due to time constraints on my side . So , this hypothesis is still to be confirmed or denied.According to the result of bullet point 13 , it seems like the whole issue only appears when using Windows . Therefore , I think that it might be a bug in the platform specific parts of the javax.sound.sampled API.Even though I think I might have found a way to change when this issue starts to happen , I 'm not satisfied with the result . I could periodically close and reopen the line to avoid the problem from starting to appear at all . However , doing this would result in some arbitrary small amount of time where I would n't be able to capture audio samples . Furthermore , the Javadoc states that some lines ca n't be reopened at all after being closed . Therefore , this is not a good solution in my case.Ideally , this whole issue should n't be happening at all . Is there something I am completely missing or am I experiencing limitations of what is possible with the javax.sound.sampled API ? How can I get rid of this issue at all ? Edit : By suggestion of Xtreme Biker and gidds I created a small example application . You can find it inside this Github repository ."

"Intro : I want to create a multithreaded android app . My problem is the communication between the threads . I read about communication between threads and I came across stuff like Looper/Handler design , which seemed quite involved and Atomic Variables like AtomicInteger .

Also I got a little suspicious of my method , when I noticed I need actually something like AtomicFloat , but it 's not existing . I felt like I am missusing the concept . I also found that you can make yourself an AtomicFloat , but I am just not sure if I am on the right way or if there is a better technique .

"I have a C API that I 'm trying to use within Clojure , through the JNA API . My issue can best be demonstrated with the following example . Say I have this C code in a library : In this example , I 'd like to call createStruct , and then pass that result to addStruct . The important point here is that MyStruct is passed by value as both a return type and an argument . At no point do I need to actually read the values of the fields in MyStruct.Additionally , in my system , native functions are wrapped like this : The goal is to get a type to substitute for Integer above that will wrap MyStruct as a value.The only resource that I 've found covering this subject is this article , but it only discusses how to pass structs by reference.Given that , here are the different approaches I 've tried to take to solve this problem : Create a class that inherits from Structure , which is JNA 's built-in mechanism for creating and using structs . Given the information on that page , I tried to create the following class using only Clojure : deftype does n't work for this scenario , since the class needs to inherit from the abstract class Structure , and gen-class does n't work because the class needs to have the public non-static fields foo , bar and baz.From what I can tell , none of the standard Clojure Java interop facilities can create the above class.Create a class that inherits from Structure and override the struct field getter/setter methods . Since gen-class is ( I believe ) the only Clojure construct that allows for direct inheritance , and it does n't support multiple public non-static fields , the next alternative is to simply not use fields at all . Looking at the Structure abstract class documentation , it seems like there 's a concoction of overrides possible to use 'virtual ' struct fields , such that it really gets and sets data from a different source ( such as the state field from gen-class ) . Looking through the documentation , it seems like overriding readField , writeField , and some other methods may have the intended effect , but the I was unclear how to do this from reading the documentation , and I could n't find any similar examples online.Use a different storage class . JNA has a myriad of classes for wrapping native types . I 'm wondering if , rather than defining and using a Structure class , I could use another generic class that can take an arbitrary number of bits ( like how Integer can hold anything that 's 4 bits wide , regardless of what type the source 'actually ' is ) . Is it possible to , for example , say that a function returns an array of bytes of length 16 ( since sizeof ( MyStruct ) is 16 ) ? What about wrapping a fixed-size array in a container class that implements NativeMapped ? I could n't find examples of how to do either ."

"I read about some of the details of implementation of ReentrantLock in `` Java Concurrency in Practice '' , section 14.6.1 , and something in the annotation makes me confused : Because the protected state-manipulation methods have the memory semantics of a volatile read or write and ReentrantLock is careful to read the owner field only after calling getState and write it only before calling setState , ReentrantLock can piggyback on the memory semantics of the synchronization state , and thus avoid further synchronization see Section 16.1.4.the code which it refers to : And I believe this is the simplified code of the nonfairTryAcquire in the ReentrantLock.Sync.So , the baffling part is how the setting of owner , which is merely a plain instance variable in AbstractOwnableSynchronizer , becomes visible to else if ( current == owner ) in other threads . Indeed , the read of owner is after the calling of getState ( ) ( and the state is a volatile qualified variable of AQS ) , but after the setting of owner , there 's nothing ( can impose synchronization semantics ) at all . Data race happens ? Well , in light of the authority of this book and the thoroughly tested code , two possibilities come to my mind : The full barrier ( be it mfence or 'lock'ed instruction ) before the setting owner = current does the hidden work . But from I 've learned from several famous articles , the full barrier cares more about the writes before it as well as the reads after it . Well , if this possibility holds true , then some sentences in `` JCIP '' might be inappropriately stated.I notice that 'geographically ' the setState ( c+1 ) really comes after owner = current in the code snippet , although it 's in another branch of if-else .

My question concerns about possible concurrency issues with mixing programmatic and declarative transactions . I am developing a legacy software ( Spring + Hibernate ) that handles database connections and transactions in a programmatic fashion.The software has newer modules that are using Spring data architecture with declarative transactions ( @ Transactional ) . We have experienced database deadlocks in rare cases with Microsoft SQL Server when newer Spring services are being called from inside `` manually '' opened transactions . I think the problem is that there are two nested transactions reading/writing same tables causing deadlocks.Is there a way to mix these transactions safely or use the already started transaction in both ?

"Was just wondering at the current point in time , what is a good combination of tools/frameworks/libraries for implementing a REST API on top of J2EE that integrates to a backend RDB and using OpenID for authentication.What I am looking to implement is a server component that provides a set of services , all of which will utilise OpenID authentication , and the services will retrieve or update information to/from a backend relational database environment . What I 'm interested in are : Also any pointers to good , current tutorials , books etc.Edit : Unfortunately I have n't had as much time to research the results to this question as I 'd have liked . At this stage I 've found that installing/setting up REST with Jersey was very quick and I believe I can use a ContainerRequestFilter to provide the OpenID support as per the article here : http : //plaincode.blogspot.com/2011/07/openid-authentication-example-in-jersey.html I intend on using OpenId4Java for the OpenId support , with the PAPE extensions to get users email address returned . I do n't need OAuth as I do n't need to access any of the users other OpenID details or info on their OpenID site from my server app.I 've had a look at the latest Spring , it looks very good and if I were needing to build a web client with my solution , or had more time to look at both , I could easily have ended up leaning that way . Thanks for the good answers and replies , hard to pick a single correct answer . I 've accepted yves answer because it is correct and the way I 'm going at the moment with minimal time to research properly , but awarded the bounty to cfontes answer , as it is also correct , and he 's replied with additional information and justification ."

"I 'm using webview.capturePicture ( ) to create a Picture object that contains all the drawing objects for a webpage.I can successfully render this Picture object to a bitmap using the canvas.drawPicture ( picture , dst ) with no problems.However when I use picture.writeToStream ( fos ) to serialize the picture object out to file , and then Picture.createFromStream ( fis ) to read the data back in and create a new picture object , the resultant bitmap when rendered as above is missing any larger images ( anything over around 20KB ! by observation ) .This occurs on all the Android OS platforms that I have tested 1.5 , 1.6 and 2.1.Looking at the native code for Skia which is the underlying Android graphics library and the output file produced from the picture.writeToStream ( ) I can see how the file format is constructed.I can see that some of the images in this Skia spool file are not being written out ( the larger ones ) , the code that appears to be the problem is in skBitmap.cpp in the method It writes out the bitmap fWidth , fHeight , fRowBytes , FConfig and isOpaque values but then just writes out SERIALIZE_PIXELTYPE_NONE ( 0 ) . This means that the spool file does not contain any pixel information about the actual image and therefore can not restore the picture object correctly.Effectively this renders the writeToStream and createFromStream ( ) APIs useless as they do not reliably store and recreate the picture data.Has anybody else seen this behaviour and if so am I using the API incorrectly , can it be worked around , is there an explanation i.e . incomplete API / bug and if so are there any plans for a fix in a future release of Android ?

"I 'm working on a 3D space trading game with some people , and one of the things I 've been assigned to do is to make a guidance computer 'tunnel ' that the ship travels through , with the tunnel made of squares that the user flies through to their destination , increasing in number as the user gets closer to the destination.It 's only necessary to render the squares for the points ahead of the ship , since that 's all that 's visible to the user . On their way to a destination , the ship 's computer is supposed to put up squares on the HUD that represent fixed points in space between you and the destination , which are small in the distance and get larger as the points approach the craft.I 've had a go at implementing this and ca n't seem to figure it out , mainly using logarithms ( Math.log10 ( x ) and such ) . I tried to get to get the ship position in 'logarithmic space ' to help find out what index to start from when drawing the squares , but then the fact that I only have distance to the destination to work with confuses the matter , especially when you consider that the number of squares has to vary dynamically to make sure they stay fixed at the right locations in space ( i.e. , the squares are positioned at intervals of 200 or so before being transformed logarithmically ) .With regard to this , I had a working implementation with the ship between a start of 0.0d and end of 1.0d , although the implementation was n't so nice .

"My question is an extension to this one : Volatile guarantees and out-of-order executionTo make it more concrete , let 's say we have a simple class which can be in two states after it is initialized : The field initialized is declared volatile , so it introduces happen-before 'barrier ' which ensures that reordering ca n't take place . Since the state field is written only before initialized field is written and read only after the initialized field is read , I can remove the volatile keyword from declaration of the state and still never see a stale value . Questions are : Is this reasoning correct ? Is it guaranteed that the write to initialized field wo n't be optimized away ( since it changes only the first time ) and the 'barrier ' wo n't be lost ? Suppose , instead of the flag , a CountDownLatch was used as an initializer like this : Would it still be alright ?"

"I 'm trying to add some mouse listeners to the sub menus/ cascading menus of GWT 's MenuBar . Sadly , I can not seem to access the submenu popuppanel directly - the method to do so ( getPopup ( ) ) is private . And you ca n't access it via reflection due to the way GWT compiles . Adding a mouse listener to the main menu bar ( to detect when the mouse is inside the menu bar boundaries ) was nice and simple . But I ca n't figure out any way to add a mouse listener to tell when the mouse is inside one of the cascading sub menus . What I am doing is this : This works great for the actual GWT MenuBar . When I mouse in , the mouseOverEvent triggers . When I mouse out , the MouseOutEvent triggers . The problem is that if I open a submenu from the main menubar , mousing into that menu will also trigger the MouseOutEvent . I need it not to do that . When I say submenu I mean something like the ones seen here : http : //www.gwtproject.org/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/MenuBar.htmlSo as long as I 'm in the 'main ' bar that lists Style , Fruit , and Term , the mouse events recognize this . But if I drop down to the sub menu that says Bold , Italicized , More , the mouse events believe I have left the menu bar entirely . I need a way to determine if the mouse is inside one of these submenus .

I 'm looking for another way to get to MenuBar.popup It seems there is no method to tell if one of the sub menus is open , as well , which is a bit perplexing to me .

"So I 've been lead to believe that using the `` + '' operator to append Strings on a single line was just as efficient as using a StringBuilder ( and definitely much nicer on the eyes ) .

"I am following the MVVM pattern - meaning I have a ViewModel for each Fragment.I added two tabs by using ViewPager2.My adapter looks like this : The tabs are working . However , I noticed that the ViewModel of my MergedItemsFragment is behaving weirdly.Before I added tabs I navigated to the Fragment like this : When I left that fragment with NavHostFragment.findNavController ( this ) .popBackStack ( ) and later on returned to that fragment I would get a new empty ViewModel . This was intended.With the new approach I am navigating with return new MergedItemsFragment ( ) . When I leave that fragment and later on return I am getting a ViewModel that contains the old data . That is an issue because the old data is not relevant anymore because the User selected different data in another fragment.Update # 1I realized that he actually keeps all the old Fragments in memory because the same print statements gets called multiple times . The times it is called increases with the amount of times I leave and return to that screen . So if I leave and return 10 times and rotate my device he will actually execute one line 10 times .

In my sample project I have two entities Organization and Person that maintain parent-child relationship . When I fetch Organization Objectify automatically fetches child Person . Also I created two methods in my service layer findOrganizationById and saveOrganization that load and persist objects.Now consider two scenarios : When I call findOrganizationById in the client following calls occur on server side : By calling OrderDao.findOrganizationById I 've already received full graph of objects . Why call .find twice in addition to that ? It 's extra load on Datastore that cost me money . Of course I cache it but it would be neat to fix it . How can I avoid these additional calls ? Similar thing happens when I save object ( s ) by calling saveOrganization in the client . Following calls occur on server side : I can understand need for fetching two objects from DataStore before updating it . RequestFactory sends deltas to the server so it needs to have entire object before persisting it . Still since I load full graph at once it would be nice not to have second call which is PojoLocator.find ( Key < ? > ( Organization ( 1 ) /Person ( 2 ) ) ) . And I truly ca n't understand need for .find ( ) calls after persisting.Thoughts ? My proxiesMy serviceand finally my Locator < >

Since j runs from 1 to i^2 , this will happen when m= { 1 , 2 , ... , i } , which means it will be true i times , and i can at most be n , so the worst case will be m= { 1,2 , ... , n } = n times . The second loop should have a worsts case of O ( N^2 ) if i = n.The outer loop has a worst case complexity of O ( N ) . I argue that this will combine in the following way : O ( N^2 ) for the inner loop * O ( N^2 ) for the second loop * O ( N ) for the outer loop gives a worst case time complexity of O ( N^5 ) However , the if-statement guarantees that we will only reach the inner loop n times , not n^2 .

"I wonder if using an IllegalStateException in this scenario is a good design choice for an API .

However , I would like to provide to API users the possibility to know why an XML document can not be checked ( example : DocumentBuilderFactory can not create a DocumentBuilder object ) without overwhelming them with tons of checked exception that they will have to deal with.My concerns regarding this design are : a ) Does using one single Exception type ( i.e IllegalStateException ) to return every possible caught exceptions to indicate a failure to perform the check a good idea ?

"I 've recently been developing a Java application and I 've been attempting to follow the GoF 's state pattern to attempt to tidy up the code . The program uses a multi-agent system 's agents to evaluate instructions on the behalf of a `` super agent '' ( example below ) .The super agent can exist in two states , and it 's getting messy having if statements everywhere checking the state and then performing state specific behavior.Here is a ( very ) simplified version of the program . The actual implementation has alot more state specific behavior.The state pattern would be perfect for encapsulating the behavior of the specific states into different classes according to the GoF pattern ( the superAgent class would be the context ) . However there are two problems , both of which ( IMO ) break encapsulation : Most state specific behavior needs to make changes to private members ( in the above example , instructionData ) of the super agent . The members contain data which probably should n't be accessible and definitely should n't be mutable to wrapping classes.The state specific behavior needs to be synchronized with behavior that is n't state specific . Without exposing the lock objects ( in the above example instructionLock ) by either making it public or using a getter the state and context are unable to share a lock . Exposing the lock violates OOP because it could potentially be used by wrapping/extending classes.Does anyone have any suggestions regarding how I could encapsulate this state specific behavior , bearing in mind the example and the two points above ?"

"I 've identified what is at least undesirable behavior and at most a bug in the Sun JDK 's handling of reflection on Java enums with an abstract method . I 've searched for a bug report and StackOverflow answer for this particular behavior and come up dry . You 're more or less always wrong when you think you 've found an issue like this in such well-used and carefully-tested code , so please sanity check me and tell me where I 've gotten this wrong.The CodeConsider the following code : a/Greeting.javab/EnumTest.javaAlso , please note that Greeting and EnumTest are in different packages . ( This ends up mattering . ) The ErrorWhen you run this code , you expect to get the following output : Instead , you get the following output : Understanding the BehaviorFirst , please note that Greeting is public and Greeting $ greet is public . ( Even the error message indicates public access ! ) So what 's going on ? What The Heck is Going On Here ? If you step through the code , you find that the ultimate `` problem '' is that sun.reflect.Reflection $ verifyMemberAccess ( ) returns false . ( So , the Reflection API claims we do not have access to this method . ) The particular code that fails is here : Essentially , this method determines whether code in currentClass can see members of memberClass with modifiers of modifiers.Clearly , we should have access . We 're calling a public method in a public class ! However , this code returns false , in the indicated return statement . Therefore , the class of the value we 're trying to invoke the method on is not public . ( We know this because the outer test -- ! Modifier.isPublic ( getClassAccessFlags ( memberClass ) ) -- passes , since the code reaches the inner return . ) But Greeting is public ! However , the type of Greeting.HELLO is not a.Greeting . It 's a.Greeting $ 1 ! ( As careful readers will have noticed above . ) enum classes with one or more abstract methods create child classes under the covers ( one for each constant ) . So what 's happening is that the `` under the covers '' child classes are not marked public , so we 're not allowed to see public methods on those classes . Bummer.Confirmation of the TheoryTo test this theory , we can invoke the superclass enum 's greet ( ) method on the child instead : ... and meet with success : Also , if we move a.Greeting to b.Greeting ( the same package as b.EnumTest ) , that works too , even without the getSuperclass ( ) call.So ... Bug or No ? So ... is this a bug ? Or is this simply undesired behavior that is an artifact of the underlying implementation ? I checked the relevant section of the Java Language Specification and this syntax is legal . Also , the specification does n't specify how child classes will be arranged , so while this technically in violation of the standard ( or at least the part of the standard I read ) , I 'm inclined to call this a bug.What does StackOverflow think : is this a bug , or simply undesired behavior ? I realize this is a bit of an unconventional question , so please forgive the format.Also , I 'm on a Mac ( in case that matters ) , and java -version prints the following , for anyone who wants to reproduce : EDIT : Interesting to find a bug open for an similar ( at least related ) issue since 1997 : http : //bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do ? bug_id=4071957EDIT : Per the answer below , the JLS does say that enum classes with an abstract method shall behave like anonymous classes : The optional class body of an enum constant implicitly defines an anonymous class declaration ( §15.9.5 ) that extends the immediately enclosing enum type . The class body is governed by the usual rules of anonymous classesPer the bug above , anonymous class handling has been a `` bug '' since 1997 . So with respect to whether this is actually a bug or not is a bit semantic at this point . Bottom line : do n't do this , since it does n't work and it 's not likely to in the future . : )"

I have been using Java + AspectJ extensively for my startup .

"I 'm trying to determine if I need to recompile some jars in our build chain , if I have for example the following structure , jar 1 compiles when its ' source changes and jar 2 compiles when its ' source changes or when jar 1 has recompiled.jar 1 : jar 2 : Assuming the contract between the 2 classes does n't change , ie . an abstract method is added or a method is added to an interface , etc.Do I need to recompile jar 2 ? ie . if some changes are made to a private method within Foo would Bar need to be recompiled ? I tried testing this by comparing the bytecode of two classes after changing a bunch in one and as expected it did not change . My coworkers however insist that they have encountered situations where even though the contract was unchanged they had to recompile everything for it to work , however they ca n't remember what the reason was ... So the burden of proof is on me to show that that should not be necessary .

"I 've run across a rather strange problem that I can create when running Java 8 . The problem presents itself as if some sort of timing error is happening within the JVM itself . It is intermittent in nature , but easily reproducible ( at least within my test environments ) . The problem is that an array value being explicitly set is being destroyed and replaced with a 0.0 under certain circumstances . Specifically , in the code below , array [ 0 ] is evaluating to 0.0 after the line new Double ( r.nextDouble ( ) ) ; . Then , if you immediately look at the contents of array [ 0 ] again , it now shows the value to be the correct value of 1.0 . Sample output from running this test case is : I 'm running 64-bit Windows 7 and am able to reproduce this problem , from both within Eclipse and when compiling from the command line , with JDKs 1.8_45 , 1.8_51 , and 1.8_60 . I am unable to produce the problem running 1.7_51 . The same results have been demonstrated on another 64-bit Windows 7 box.This problem appeared in a large , non-trivial piece of software , but I 've managed to condense it down to a few lines of code . Below is a small test case that demonstrates the issue . It is a rather odd looking test case , but appears to all be necessary to cause the error . The use of Random is not required - I can replace all r.nextDouble ( ) with any double value and demonstrate the issue . Interestingly enough , if someArray [ 0 ] = .45 ; is replaced with someArray [ 0 ] = r.nextDouble ( ) ; , I could not replicate the issue ( although there is nothing special about .45 ) . Eclipse debugging is also of no help - it changes the timing enough such that it does n't happen anymore . Even a well placed System.err.println ( ) statement will cause the issue to no longer appear.Again , the issue is intermittent , so to reproduce the issue one might have to run this test case several times . I think the most I 've had to run it is around 10 times before I get the output shown above . In Eclipse , I give it a second or two after running and then kill it if it has n't happened . From the command line the same - run it , if it does n't happen CTRL+C to quit and try again . It appears that if it 's going to happen , it happens pretty quickly.I 've come across issues like this in the past , but they were all threading issues . I ca n't figure out what 's going on here - I 've even looked at bytecode ( which was identical between 1.7_51 and 1.8_45 , by the way ) .Any ideas on what is happening here ?"

"In my Spring application , I have components that use Spring 's caching mechanism . Each @ Cacheable annotation specifies the cache that is to be used . I 'd like to autodiscover all the caches that are needed at startup so that they can be automatically configured.The simplest approach seemed to create a marker interface ( ex : CacheUser ) to be used by each caching component : I would then have Spring autodiscover all the implementations of this interface and autowire them to a configuration list that can be used when configuring the cache manager ( s ) . This works.My plan was to take each discovered class and find all methods annotated with @ Cacheable . From there I would access the annotation 's properties and obtain the cache name . I 'm using AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation ( ) to get the annotation declaration.That 's where the plan falls apart . Spring actually wires proxies instead of the raw component , and the annotations are n't copied over to the proxies ' methods . The only workaround I 've found exploits the fact that the proxy implements Advised which provides access to the proxied class : From there I can get the original annotations , but this approach is clearly brittle.So two questions , really : Is there a better way to get to the annotations defined by the proxied class ? Can you suggest any other way to discover all uses of @ Cacheable in my project ? I 'd love to do without a marker interface.Thanks !"

"Before asking my question I want to make some things clear . First , I am new to Java and programming in general . Second , This is my second post so please go easy on me if I did something wrong . Finally , I would like an explanation as to why what I did was wrong instead of just a pasted solution in any responses to this post . To better understand the issue I will write the assignment information , then the Driver class that is given , then my class code that is accessed by the Driver class . My question : How can I get the bottom left of my 'building ' to be [ 0 ] [ 0 ] on my 2D array ? Here 's an example of a for loop that works in changing the bottom left of a 2D array to [ 0 ] [ 0 ] , but I tried implementing this into my searchRoom method ( where the player character is set to myHidingPlaces index ) and I ca n't get myHidingPlaces [ 0 ] [ 0 ] to be the bottom left of my 2D Array . I believe that i need to edit the toString method somehow with for loops , but I ca n't figure out how I should do it.The following is the assignment : You are to design a class “ LostPuppy.java ” which represents a puppy lost in a multi-floor building thatcontains the same number of rooms on each floor . During instantiation ( or creation ) of an object of this class , each room on each floor will be initialized as empty ( you will actually use the space ‘ ‘ character for thispurpose ) and a random room will be chosen where the puppy is lost . For this purpose , the character “ P ” willbe placed in this random location . Further details on the constructor is listed below.An object of this class is used as a game for two players to take turns searching for the puppy , one room at atime until the unfortunate little canine is found . The instantiation of this object and the search will be performedby a “ driver ” program which has been provided to you allowing you to only have to concentrate on developingthe class ( the driver program is in the file “ PuppyPlay.java ” ) Fields ( of course , all fields are private ) : A character ( char ) array named myHidingPlaces . This represents the building where the rows are floorsand the columns are rooms on each floor ( this building has an unusual numbering system ; the floors androoms both start at zero ) .Two integers that will hold the floor and room where the puppy is lost , named myFloorLocation andmyRoomLocation.A char named myWinner which will be assigned the player ’ s character when a player finds the puppy ( the driver program uses digits ‘ 1 ’ and ‘ 2 ’ to more clearly distinguish the players from the puppy ) .A boolean named myFound which is set to true when the puppy is found.Constructor : Receives two integer parameters as the user ’ s input for the number of floors and rooms of the buildingin which the puppy is lost.The constructor instantiates the 2D array “ myHidingPlaces ” as a character array with the first parameterfor the rows ( theFloors ) and the second parameter as the columns ( theRooms ) .Initialize myHidingPlaces ’ cells , each to contain a space ‘ ‘ ( done with single quotes ) Set myFloorLocation ( floor puppy is on ) randomly based using the first parameterSet myRoomLocation ( room puppy is in ) randomly based using the second parameterSet myHidingPlaces [ myFloorLocation ] [ myRoomLocation ] to the char ‘ P ’ Set myWinner to a single spaceSet myFound to falseMethods : roomSearchedAlready receives the floor and room to be searched and returns true if the room hasalready been searched , false otherwise.puppyLocation receives the floor and room to be searched and returns true if the floor and room arewhere the puppy is lost , false otherwise . This method should NOT change any of the fields.indicesOK receives the floor and room to be searched and returns true if the floor and room values arewithin the array indices range , false otherwise ( used to check that these indices will not cause an errorwhen applied to the array ) .numberOfFloors returns how many floors are in the building ( the first floor starts at zero ) .numberOfRooms returns how many rooms are on each floor of the building ( the first room starts atzero and all floors have the same number of rooms ) .searchRoom receives the floor and room to be searched and also the current player ( as a char type ) and returns true if the puppy is found , false otherwise . If the puppy is NOT found searchRoom alsosets the myHidingPlaces array at the received floor and room location to the received player value ( a ‘ 1 ’ or a ‘ 2 ’ ) OR , when found , sets the myWinner field to the current player AND sets myFound to true.toString displays the current hidingPlaces array and it ’ s contents EXCEPT the location of the puppywhich remains hidden until he/she is found at which point toString will be called ( by the driver ) and boththe player who found the puppy and a ‘ P ’ will be displayed in the same cell….NOW , and perhaps the awkward portion of the toString output . Normally , when displaying a 2D array , the [ 0 ] [ 0 ] cell is displayed in the upper left corner as with matrices . However , because the puppydecided to get lost in a building and not a matrix , it would make more visual sense to have the first floor ( row 0 ) displayed on the bottom , second floor above it… and finally the top floor , well… on top ! Tosave words , look closely at the sample run provided on the next page . Your output should look thesame as what is seen on the next page in the sample run.Here is the Driver program : Finally , here is my test code :"

"I appear to have hit a wall in my most recent project involving wave/ripple generation over an image .

I was following an algorithm that people are calling the Hugo Elias method ( though idk if he truly came up with the design ) . His tutorial can be found here ! When following that tutorial I found his pseudo code challenging to follow . I mean the concept for the most part makes sense until I hit the height map portion over an image . The problem being the x and y offsets throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException due to him adding the offset to the corresponding x or y .

That log does n't make anything clear for me . I 've noticed the problem after updating Android Studio to 2.3 and updating some dependencies in the project . Before it worked fine.I will appreciate any help in solving this issue.Edit : After some trials I 've found out that the way I create a build makes difference . If I build my project with Build/Build APK and adb install app-debug.apk it wo n't throw an exception . But every time I use Run/Run 'app ' option to deploy the app to the device , installing apk created this way through terminal results in a crash with mentioned exception . Is it intended behaviour or a bug ? Also worth noticing that Build/Clean project fixes the problem for the next build ."
"I tried to test Bing Map API 's accuracy . I tried to find out the distance and driving time between Chicago O'Hare International Airport and Chicago Midway Airport . It appears that Bing Map API is completely inaccurate . I double and triple checked it manually with bing maps . Here is the complete code This is the link to the JARsThe result that I got was The above results are absolutely inaccurate . I compared manually the numbers with Bing Map Click this link to see the difference . When I tried using different addresses , the driving time would in most cases be calculated fine . . . however the distance is almost always higher than the one that I would get typing in the addresses manually into the Bing Map . . . Is it the issue with the Bing Map API ? Maybe I should use the getDistance method in a different way ? Although the distances are close to what Bing Map shows manually however not exactly the same . How come they are not the same ? Thank You !"
"I 'd like to combine MapStruct mappers with Spring 's Conversion model .

What I 'd like to do is tell a Mapper to use the ConversionService for employing another mapper . However , since the ConversionService 's convert method does n't match MapStruct 's standard pattern for a mapping method , the code generation plugin does n't recognise that it can use the service when looking for a submapping .

"We have a cron job that runs every hour on a backend module and creates tasks . The cron job runs queries on the Cloud SQL database , and the tasks make HTTP calls to other servers and also update the database . Normally they run great , even when thousands of tasks as created , but sometimes it gets `` stuck '' and there is nothing in the logs that can shed some light on the situation.For example , yesterday we monitored the cron job while it created a few tens of tasks and then it stopped , along with 8 of the tasks that also got stuck in the queue . When it was obvious that nothing was happening we ran the process a few more times and each time completed successfully.After a day the original task was killed with a DeadlineExceededException and then the 8 other tasks , that were apparently running in the same instance , were killed with the following message : A problem was encountered with the process that handled this request , causing it to exit . This is likely to cause a new process to be used for the next request to your application . If you see this message frequently , you may be throwing exceptions during the initialization of your application . ( Error code 104 ) Until the processes were killed we saw absolutely no record of them in the logs , and now that we see them there are no log records before the time of the DeadlineExceededException , so we have no idea at what point they got stuck.We suspected that there is some lock in the database , but we see in the following link that there is a 10 minute limit for queries , so that would cause the process to fail much sooner than one day : https : //cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/cloud-sql/ # Java_Size_and_access_limitsOur module 's class and scaling configuration is : The configuration of the queue is : I uploaded some images of the trace data for the cron job : http : //imgur.com/a/H5wGG.This includes the trace summary , and the beginning/ending of the timeline.There is no trace data for the 8 terminated tasks.What could be the cause of this and how can we investigate it further ?"

I 'm going through the Sharded Counters example in Java : http : //code.google.com/appengine/articles/sharding_counters.html I have a question about the implementation of the increment method . In python it explicitly wraps the get ( ) and increment in a transaction . In the Java example it just retrieves it and sets it . I 'm not sure I fully understand the Datastore and transactions but it seems like the critical update section should be wrapped in a datastore transaction . Am I missing something ?

"Here is some sample code for reentrant locking from 'Java concurrency in practice ' : The book explains that in the above code ... '' Because the doSomething methods in Widget and LoggingWidget are both synchronized , each tries to acquire the lock on the Widget before proceeding . `` I ran the above code to observe the intrinsic lock . The above quote seems to imply that a thread acquires an intrinsic lock on the Widget object , but what I observed was that the thread acquires a lock on LoggingWidget . I am not sure how to verify the acquisition count , so was n't able to observe that.Is the book using the names LoggingWidget/Widget interchangeably or should I be observing a lock on the Widget object specifically ? Edit : Full Excerpt Reentrancy facilitates encapsulation of locking behavior , and thus simplifies the development of object-oriented concurrent code . Without reentrant locks , the very natural-looking code in Listing 2.7 , in which a subclass overrides a synchronized method and then calls the superclass method , would deadlock . Because the doSomething methods in Widget and LoggingWidget are both synchronized , each tries to acquire the lock on the Widget before proceeding . But if intrinsic locks were not reentrant , the call to super.doSomething would never be able to acquire the lock because it would be considered already held , and the thread would permanently stall waiting for a lock it can never acquire . Reentrancy saves us from deadlock in situations like this ."

"This is kind of maddening , and I 've never seen it happen before in several years of working with Maven . A single , simple project ( that I did not write myself ) will randomly fail to filter resources , and I can not figure out what might cause it . I ca n't share the project source code , but I 'll try to share as much of the POM as I can . Keep in mind that the problem is not with the code , it 's with Maven randomly deciding not to filter resources . I initially had this configured in my POM 's build tag : And in my src/main/resources directory I have a file called spring-config.xml . This file has several properties in it that should be replaced by Maven profile properties . I have configured my build profiles like so : To build , I run this command : Now , this project uses Spring and it uses the same Spring config for testing and execution , so the context will create a database connection when test cases are run . Most of the time , the build will complete and the test cases will pass . However , about 1 time in 10 , the test cases will fail because the properties were not replaced and Spring tries to connect to `` $ { db.url } '' rather than `` jdbc : oracle : thin : @ xxx.xxx.com:1521 : xxx '' . Weirdly , about 9 times in 10 , the packaged JAR will have the same problem , despite having just passed the test cases . I checked the target/classes directory , and the files there have the exact same problem . I figured something odd was going on with the Maven resource plugin at a certain point in the lifecycle of the build and maybe it was overwriting the files incorrectly . My bandaid solutionIn the Maven lifecycle , the order is compile- > test- > package . So to force the resources to be filtered on the two phases that were giving me headaches , I configured the resources plugin to run on both the compile and the test phase : This appears to be working consistently , but I still have no earthly idea why I needed to to do this for a single project out of the dozens I 've worked on in the last few years .

"I apologize . This question is part of a programming assignment . We 're asked to implementa method that changes a fraction f from base A to base B with P digits of precision . The function has signaturebaseChanger ( int [ ] f , int A , int B , int P ) .For example , the decimal 3.14159 has fraction 0.14159 and is represented as an array : A fraction in base-16 -- 0.3BA07 -- would be writtenThe binary fraction 0.01 converted to a decimal fraction is 0.25 , and a test of the conversion function would look like this : This is the algorithm we were asked to implement : So with `` from '' and `` to '' as above , this would mean doing the following : Create an array that can hold P digits : int [ ] output = new int [ P ] ; // output = { 0 , 0 } Take the rightmost digit of `` from '' : { 0 , 1 < == } Multiply that digit by B ( 10 here ) and add the carry ( zero , currently ) , and assign to x : x < -- 1 x 10 + 0 = 10Replace the rightmost digit ( currently 1 ) with x mod A ( 2 here ) : { 0 , 0 < == } Calculate the carry , which is x / A : carry < -- 10 / 2 = 5Assign carry to the 0th slot in output : output [ 0 ] < -- carryoutput : { 5 < == , 0 } This procedure is repeated once more , and output is nowBut notice that the digits are in the wrong order and are output from least significant to most significant ! Also , ( more importantly ) , what would be done for a conversion from a decimal fraction like 0.3 to binary ? Suppose you wanted , say , 12 digits of precision . There is no exact binary representation , of course , so what would you do here , especially since the least significant digits come out first ? I 'm not sure where to start and would appreciate some advice . Remember that these numbers are fractions , not whole numbers and that the algorithm has to finish in linear time ."
"This question is not primarily about Strings . Out of academic curiosity I would like to know how the final modifier on a variable can change the behaviour a program .

"I am currently working on some networking code ( this is my first server ) and had a quick question about optimizing a specific function which writes values as bits and then packs them into a byte . The reason for optimizing this function is because it is used thousands of times each server tick for packing data to be sent to several clients.An example may serve better in order to explain what the function tries to accomplish : The value 3 can be represented by two bits.In binary , it would look like 00000011 . The function would turn this binary value into 11000000 . When the function is called again , it would know to start from the 3rd most significant bit ( 3rd from the right/decimal 32 ) and write at most up to 6 bits into the current byte . If then there were remaining bits to write , it would start on a new byte.The purpose of this is to save space if you have multiple values that can be less than byte.My current function looks like this : As I 'm new to this I think there may be more efficient ways , maybe using bit-masking or a lookup table of some sort ? Any ideas or steering in the right direction would be great . Cheers ."
"I am in the process of developing a hybrid Phonegap app for Android . The app uses just the one plugin which I am developing as well . The plugin does three thingsWatches for geo-location changes ( both foreground and background ) Sets up a half-hourly alarm to perform certain periodic tasksListens for push messages . I use the pushy.me service and the code I use follows their documentation.I had implemented the code to get the application to tune in to device reboots with some trepidation but it turned out to be easy ( thanks to information I found in other threads on SO ) I register the reboot receiver thusMyAppCordovaPlugin is the entry point to my app/plugin - the one that extends the CordovaPlugin class . Here is what I do thereWhen I start up the app manually on my Android 4.4.2 test device everything works perfectly . i.e.Geo location changes are detected : both in the foreground and in the backgroundpush messages are received . Once again both in f/g and in b/gThe half hourly alarm worksWhen I examine the running app I find that it consists of one service PushySocketService and the main process , com.example.app which is marked as being in use . Memory usage is considerable.When I restart the phone I still find the same service and `` main process '' running . However , the memory usage reported for the main process is significantly lower.Most importantly - the app does not recieve push messages and does not respond to geo location changes . This only starts happening after I have launched the app by main activity.I must be missing something here - so the rebooted app does not automatically start its main activity ? If so there must be something wrong with my Rebooter.onReceive code ? For completeness I should mentionOnly the Pushy.me and Rebooter broadcast receivers are declared statically in the plugin.xml file . The Geo location and alarm broadcast receivers are registered dynamically from within my plugin code.I am building the app using Phonegap CLI v 6.4.2 and JDK 7I am clearly doing something wrong here .

"In java , an EnumSet stores the items it contains in a bitmask / bit vector using a long ( RegularEnumSet ) or long [ ] ( JumboEnumSet ) . I have now come across a use case where I have many thousand domain Objects ( let 's call them Node ) , each of which will show all items of an enum ( let 's call that Flag ) in an order that will vary per Object.Currently I am storing the Order as Guava ImmutableSet , because that guarantees to retain insertion order . However , I have used the methods explained on this page to compare memory usage in an EnumSet < Flag > , an ImmutableSet < Flag > and a Flag [ ] . Here are the results when a ) Flag has 64 enum items and b ) all three variants contain all 64 items : EnumSet : 32 bytes ImmutableSet : 832 bytes Array : 272 bytesSo my question is : is there a clever way to pack the enum ordering into a numeric value to get a memory footprint smaller than that of the array ? If it makes a difference : in my use case I would assume that the ordering always contains all Enum items.To clarify : my enum is much smaller than that and I do n't have any memory problems as of now , nor is it likely that this situation will ever give me memory problems . It 's just that this inefficiency bugs me , even on this microscopic level.Update : After suggestions from the various answers and comments I came up with this data structure that uses a byte array . Caveat : It does n't implement the Set interface ( does n't check for unique values ) and it wo n't scale to large enums beyond what a byte can hold . Also , the complexity is pretty awful , because Enum.values ( ) has to be queried repeatedly ( see here for a discussion of this problem ) , but here goes : The memory footprint is : EnumOrdering:104That 's a pretty good result so far , thanks to bestsss and JB Nizet !

"After several days passed to investigate about the issue , I decided to submit this question because there is no sense apparently in what is happening.The CaseMy computer is configured with a local Oracle Express database.I have a JAVA project with several JUnit Tests that extend a parent class ( I know that it is not a `` best practice '' ) which opens an OJDBC Connection ( using a static Hikari connection pool of 10 Connections ) in the @ Before method and rolled Back it in the @ After.StacicConnectionPool } This project has hundreds tests ( not in parallel ) that use this connection ( on localhost ) to execute queries ( insert/update and select ) using Sql2o but transaction and clousure of connection is managed only externally ( by the test above ) . The database is completely empty to have ACID tests.So the expected result is to insert something into DB , makes the assertions and then rollback . in this way the second test will not find any data added by previous test in order to maintain the isolation level.The ProblemRunning all tests together ( sequentially ) , 90 % of times they work properly . the 10 % one or two tests , randomly , fail , because there is dirty data in the database ( duplicated unique for example ) by previous tests . looking the logs , rollbacks of previous tests were done properly . In fact , if I check the database , it is empty ) If I execute this tests in a server with higher performance but the same JDK , same Oracle DB XE , this failure ratio is increased to 50 % . This is very strange and I have no idea because the connections are different between tests and the rollback is called each time . The JDBC Isolation level is READ COMMITTED so even if we used the same connection , this should not create any problem even using the same connection.So my question is : Why it happen ? do you have any idea ? Is the JDBC rollback synchronous as I know or there could be some cases where it can go forward even though it is not fully completed ?

"This is a continuation of this question : WCF and ColdFusionSo I managed to get a JAR working using Metro and importing the WSDL . My main class has the following functions : getVersion ( ) and my implementation myVersion ( ) , cancelOrder ( ) and myCancel ( ) and , finally , placeOrder and myOrder ( ) .I 'm able to pass the correct information and get a response back from the webservices for the first 2 methods ( getVersion and cancelOrder ) : For example , in the myVersion method , it calls the webservice and outputs the version number plus the passed string : Using the same template , I can also pass all of the other parameters in the myOrder method except the last parameter of type org.tempuri.ArrayOfSmartOrderLineRequest.This is where I 'm not confident and may need guidance : In going through documentation and the generated classes , I 'll put what is in documentation in block quotes and how I understand them underneath.myOrder is supposed to take all of the parameters passed in through ColdFusion and put it into a request object.That last line , JavaCast ( `` org.tempuri.ArrayOfSmartOrderLineRequest '' , orderItems ) is my issue . I get a JavaCast type org.tempuri.ArrayOfSmartOrderLineRequest must be one of the following types : byte , char , short , int , long , float , double , boolean , string , bigdecimal , their corresponding array representation ( eg : int [ ] ) , or null.error , which makes sense . If I make it into null , nothing gets passed into the SoapMessage.My question is this : How do I pass that final parameter ? orderItems is a CF variable , which is , I believe , referenced to a Java Object.Working backwards , ArrayOfSmartOrderLineRequest.java has a single method getSmartOrderLineRequest . According to the notes in the generated java file : This accessor method returns a reference to the live list , not a snapshot . Therefore any modification you make to the returned list will be present inside the JAXB object . This is why there is not a set method for the smartOrderLineRequest property . It continues on to : For example , to add a new item , do as follows : getSmartOrderLineRequest ( ) .add ( newItem ) ; I take this to mean that I have to create a newItem object and pass that into the add method of getSmartOrderLineRequest , correct ? So , in building the newItem object , I created the myItem variable , which has three properties : PLU , PluSalesProgramId and Quantity.In my head , I am creating a myItem object in CF , which is being held in Java , then telling the Java method getSmartOrderLineRequest `` Hey , ADD myItem to your array . `` Any help would be greatly appreciated . I feel like I 'm almost there , but I do n't know in which direction I should head.Edit 1 : Response to Leigh 's comments.Not a silly question as to what happens when I just passed the object by itself . I recreated the following steps and I 'm getting a weird error : At first , I tried the following : I tried with the following code , and it did n't error : I passed it along using : Below is the shell of the ArrayOfSmartOrderLineRequest.java : Below is the definition of the object from the WSDL : Edit 2 : Taking Leigh 's adviceUsing the Psuedo-Code as a template , I took it one step at a time.1 ) Create the items that will need to be passed.A cfdump of myItem reveals the following methods : According to the documentation , the order of the parameters are PluSalesProgramId , PLU , Quantity.2 ) Add the information to the items.Skipped this step . *3 ) Add items to a CF array.The dump of itemArray is as follows : So far so good.4 ) Next , add reference to myItem to ArrayOfSmartOrderLineRequest.5 ) Finally , orderItems to the myOrder method : Yay ! That worked ! I 'll have to go through the code to make sure everything was done properly , but looking through the logs , it looks like the SOAP message was sent out properly and and expected error of PLU not found was returned.Leigh , if you put a something in as an answer , I 'll accept it as the answer when I get back into the office ."

"Java 8 has added three fences to sun.misc.Unsafe.I feel confused after I read their documentation.So , I searched the web , and found this link.According to the page above , I believe these methods add almost nothing in practice . Correct me if I 'm wrong , roughly speaking , loadFence ( ) , storeFence ( ) and fullFence ( ) correspond to volatile read , lazy write and volatile write respectively , although technically these fences are stronger than volatile variables . So loadFence ( ) is an acquire fence , and storeFence ( ) is a release fence , and fullFence ( ) is full fence.But then the documentation for storeFence ( ) looks strange.It says , That does n't look like a release fence . How is it supposed to be used ? Should n't it beI assume before means earlier and after means later.EDITI do n't mean `` we do n't use them in usual development '' when I say these `` fences add nothing in practice '' .I mean , even without these methods in Unsafe , we can get these `` fences '' . If I am correct , in practice , reading a dummy volatile has the effect of loadFence ( ) , and writing a dummy volatile has the effect of fullFence ( ) , and unsafe.putOrderedXXX ( ) ( or AtomicInteger.lazySet ( ) ) has the effect of storeFence ( ) .They may have subtle difference , but in current implementation , they are exchangeable . ( Seems implied by the link ) That is what I mean by `` they add nothing new '' .ANOTHER EDITThis is already fixed.See https : //bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8038978Thanks @ john-vint"

"I am working on a project to automatically convert a custom language to Java and have been asked to do some basic optimizations of the code during the conversion process . For example , the custom code may have something like : in this instance , someFunction is called multiple times with the same inputs , so additional performance can be obtained by caching the value of someFunction ( ) and only calling it once . Thus , an `` optimized '' version of the above code may look something like : Currently , this is done by hand during the conversion process . I run a program to convert the code in the custom language to Java and then manually examine the converted code to see what can be optimized . I want to automate the optimization process since these problems creep up again and again .

"I am trying to solve the following problem : given N time intervals , each specified as ( start , end ) , non-overlapping , sorted based on start - find an interval that contains a given date . For instance given:3 falls into the first interval , 15 into fourth etc.So far I had the following base ideas : We can use binary seach to find the corresponding interval ( Log N ) Since it might be the case that only a few intervals are big , and the rest small , it might be worthwhile sorting the itervals based on their duration . Then , statistically , most of the time we would 'hit ' the longest intervals ( O ( 1 ) ) , only sometimes this would result in the worst case complexity of N.I was thinking whether there is a scope to combine the two approaches . One other idea is to sort based on the duration and insert all the intervals into a tree , with comparison by start date , This , in the worst case when longest durations are in chronological order , this approach is equal in performance to 2.The ideal solution I imagined would be to have a tree ( or some similar data structure ) that would contain the longest interval on the top , then the two branches would have the next two longest intervals etc . However , I see no way to branch in that tree i.e . since we make an explicit assumption that we insert based on the length , we can not really discard left or right side of the tree.Any comments would be greatly appreciated ."

I always see advices in this site of overriding getPreferredSize ( ) instead of using setPreferredSize ( ) as shown in these previous threads for example.Use of overriding getPreferredSize ( ) instead of using setPreferredSize ( ) for fixed size ComponentsShould I avoid the use of set ( Preferred|Maximum|Minimum ) Size methods in Java Swing ? Overriding setPreferredSize ( ) and getPreferredSize ( ) See this example : setPreferredSize ( ) Sets the preferred size of this component . getPreferredSize ( ) If the preferredSize has been set to a non-null value just returns it . If the UI delegate 's getPreferredSize method returns a non null value then return that ; otherwise defer to the component 's layout manager . So doing this clearly breaks Liskov Substitution Principle.prefferedSize is a bound property so when you set it a firePropertyChange is executed . So my question is when you override getPrefferedSize ( ) do n't you need to override setPreferredSize ( .. ) too ? Example : Now we see that we get identical results but listeners will get notified with real values and besides we do n't break LSP cause setPreferredSize states Sets the preferred size of this component . but not how .

The second form provides a convenient syntax to create and call methods that can produce the same effect as C ’ s variable argument lists ( known as “ varargs ” in C ) . These can include unknown quantities of arguments as well as unknown types.I 've never known these to be different as Eckel describes . To my understanding , they are both arrays of static size .

That is , I 'd like to write a methodthat I could call with something liketo get the sum ( 1 + 1/22 + 1/32 + ... ) = ζ ( 2 ) = π2/6.My crude method for doing this the old way : which gives me a result accurate to 5 places.I can implement the method in a hacked way using iterator ( ) : but that just feels like reverting to the old way , and I was looking for a method that used streams more the way they were intended to be used , or something.This produces the correct result : but I happened to know that the old method used almost 800000 terms , and putting a limit on the stream defeats my purpose . The problem is that I do n't see a way to cut off a stream other than by using limit ( ) , which means that I have to know beforehand how many terms I 'm going to have ; I do n't see a way to stop the stream based on some condition that 's computed based on what I 'm seeing in the stream.This does n't work : A trace indicates that something does happen when the last term is seen , but nothing good : in one case , the computation stopped but the program still hung , and in another case , it gave me a cute little crash dump that I get to report to Oracle.So is there a way to accomplish the sort of thing I 'm looking for ? ( Note : I 'm assuming serial streams , for now . But I think this is the sort of problem that could benefit from parallelism , once I figure out how to make it work . )"

"I have a single .war app that uses Spring and initializes it 's context in two different ways.It uses both annotation config and XML config . So my firs question is : Is this always a bad practice and what problems can it lead to ? Secondly it uses both annotations and XML because it sets up its REST controllers using annotations and its Services/DAOs using XML.Now I have an advice that works great on the services , but does n't fire at all if used on the REST controllers.This is a relevant part of it : It is initialized in the context like so : So my second question is : Is the fact that the context is initalized both with annotations and XML the reason why the aspect wo n't fire on the controllers ? If so how can I make it work ? Thanks , Some additional info from the deployment logs.This is how the XML beans get instantiated : So if this actually creates 2 seperate bean contexts ( does it ? ) , could it be the case that the aspect does n't exist at all in the annotation initialized context ?

"I am having some problems updating a debugger to work with Java 8 . Consider the following program for example : As expected , Java 8 compiles the lambda to something like this : This looks pretty much like normal code . However , I am trying to use the Java Debugger Interface ( JDI ) to intercept every step of the program . The fist thing that goes wrong is when I handle the ClassPrepareEvent event corresponding to the lambda class . Asking the event.referenceType ( ) gives me something like Lam $ $ Lambda $ 1.1464642111 which is cool . But then calling .allLineLocations ( ) on the .referenceType ( ) gives a AbsentInformationException , which seems at odds with the LineNumberTable in the compiled file.It looks like stepping through lambda bodies in Java 8 is possible . But does anyone know how it can be done in JDI ? Updates : when .allLineLocations is called on the Lam class , it does reflect all of these line numbers . when a JDI Event happens within the lambda class ( e.g . from stepping ) , the .sourceName ( ) of the location throws an AbsentInformationExceptionit looks like jdk.internal.org.objectweb.asm . * is doing a bunch of stuff related to copying the lambdaI 'm not sure if the map from source lines to bytecodes is kept in Java , or in the JDISo my working hypothesis is that when the lambda 's class is created at runtime , the JDI needs to do something to recognize that the new class 's bytecode is coming from the old class 's bytecode ( which is in turn coming from from Lam.java ) . I do n't know enough about the internal representation of java.lang.Class or com.sun.jdi.ClassType to know where to begin.Why am I trying to do this : to update the Java Visualizer to work with lambdas"

"Question 1 : The JVM does not know about generics , therefore type parameters in Scala ( and Java ) only exist at compile-time . They do n't exist at run-time . Since Akka is a Scala ( and Java ) framework , it suffers from this very shortcoming , too . It suffers from it in particular because in Akka , messages between actors are ( obviously ) only exchanged during run-time , so all the type arguments of those very messages are lost . Correct so far ? Question 2 : Say I defined the following case class that takes one type parameter : Now , I instantiate an Event [ Int ] ( 42 ) and send it to my testActor . Is it correct that my testActor basically receives an Event [ Any ] and has no idea of what type t is ? Question 3 : Say , inside my testActor there exists a function that also takes a type parameter : The testActor calls f when receiving an Event : To what will the type parameter T of f be set when the function is called like this ? Any ? If so , would the following function effectively be equivalent to the above ( assuming it would only get called like described above ) : Question 4 : Now , consider this definition of f : I did n't change the call-site : Should n't this always print Any to the console ? When I send an Event [ Int ] ( 42 ) to my testActor , it does print java.lang.Integer to the console , though . So the type information is n't erased after all ? I am confused ."

Any hint how to solve that problem or any sources that tell why it is that way are welcome.The following question contains a use case for this constellation : Dynamically fire CDI event with qualifier with members.Basically you require something like this to narrow down which qualifier should trigger based on its members.Note that this would also apply to a Kotlin annotation as well as it seems that a Kotlin annotation can not be open and therefore not be implemented/extended too.What I found so far is rather mentioning @ Inherited as a problem : https : //discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/inherited-annotations-and-other-reflections-enchancements/6209https : //youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-22265But I did not find any reason why the annotation is not implementable/inheritable as it is in Java.I also asked this question now here : https : //discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/implement-inherit-extend-annotation-in-kotlin/8916Update : Finally I found something regarding this design decision , namely the following issue ( while I was opening my own issue for it ) : Annotations inheritance .

"With parameterized types in Java , how do the rules that check if a parameter is within its bound work exactly for wildcards ? Given a class like this : Experimenting with what the compiler accepts learns that : A ? extends wildcard using an unrelated interface type is allowed : Foo < ? extends Runnable > is validA ? extends wildcard using an unrelated class type is not allowed : Foo < ? extends Thread > is invalid . That makes sense because no type can be a subtype of both Number and ThreadIn a ? super wildcard , the lower bound in the wildcard must be subtype of the bound of the type variable : Foo < ? super Runnable > is not allowed because Runnable is not a subtype of Number . Again , this restriction makes perfect sense.But where are these rules defined ? Looking at the Java Language Specification section 4.5 , I do n't see anything distinguishing interfaces from classes ; and when applying my interpretation of the JLS Foo < ? super Runnable > is said to be valid . So I probably misunderstood something . Here 's my attempt : From that section of the JLS : A parameterized type consists of a class or interface name C and an actual type argument list < T1 , ... , Tn > . It is a compile time error if C is not the name of a generic class or interface , or if the number of type arguments in the actual type argument list differs from the number of declared type parameters of C. In the following , whenever we speak of a class or interface type , we include the generic version as well , unless explicitly excluded . Throughout this section , let A1 , ... , An be the formal type parameters of C , and let be Bi be the declared bound of Ai . The notation [ Ai : = Ti ] denotes substitution of the type variable Ai with the type Ti , for 1 < = i < = n , and is used throughout this specification . Let P = G < T1 , ... , Tn > be a parameterized type . It must be the case that , after P is subjected to capture conversion ( §5.1.10 ) resulting in the type G < X1 , ... , Xn > , for each actual type argument Xi , 1 < = i < = n , Xi < : Bi [ A1 : = X1 , ... , An : = Xn ] ( §4.10 ) , or a compile time error occurs.Apply that to P = Foo < ? super Runnable > : that gives C = Foo , n = 1 , T1 = ? super Runnable and B1 = Number.For capture conversion this part of the definition of capture conversion applies : If Ti is a wildcard type argument of the form ? super Bi , then Si is a fresh type variable whose upper bound is Ui [ A1 : = S1 , ... , An : = Sn ] and whose lower bound is Bi.That gives G < X1 , ... , Xn > = Foo < X > where X is a fresh type variable with upper bound Number and lower bound Runnable . I do n't see anything explicitly forbidding such a type variable.There are no type variables in B1 = Number , so Bi [ A1 : = X1 , ... , An : = Xn ] is still simply Number.X has Number as upper bound ( coming from the capture conversion ) , and according to the subtyping rules `` The direct supertypes of a type variable are the types listed in its bound '' , so X < : Number ( = Bi [ A1 : = X1 , ... , An : = Xn ] ) , so this parameter is within its bounds . ( But it is n't ! ) Following the same reasoning every wildcard is within its bounds , so something here is n't right ... But where exactly did this reasoning go wrong ? How do these rules work when applied correctly ?"

However , this causes a compile error in the following methodNow , I also tried changing the signature of compose in a similar manner . i.e . rather than MB extends Monad < M , B > I used Monad < M , B > where MB was used and similarly for MC .

"I 'm creating an application containing a class I 'm writing called Person . One of the fields of Person is 'aliases ' which is an ArrayList < String > . Ultimately the aliases will be displayed to the user according to the following logic : If Person has aliases then they should be displayed as [ Finch , Wren , Admin , etc ... ] , otherwise UNKNOWN should be displayed . So far I 've tried implementing this in one of three ways : Person contains the method getAliases ( ) which simply returns a copy of the ArrayList as is . The caller checks for an empty array to implement the desired behavior . Person contains the method aliasesToString ( ) which can be called to produce the desired string.Instead of using ArrayList < String > , aliases is an implementation of DefaultableArrayList < T > . This class extends ArrayList and holds a default value with type T. The toString ( ) method is overriden to produce the desired string . The application calls some_person.getAliases ( ) .toString ( ) to produce the desired behavior.Below is my implementation of option 3 : What concerns me about options 2 and 3 is that I might be adding needless complexity whilst violating OOP guidelines . Should Person really be concerned with what happens if there 's no aliases and does it make sense for aliases to define how it 's ultimately implemented in the application ? I think that I should be letting the caller handle the empty case . Which option should I choose that best meets standard OOP design guidelines ? Or is there a fourth option that I have n't considered ?"

"I 've analyzed a classloader leak the last few days in a large application and I 've worked out the problem.My application uses SolrJ which will be initialilzed through a @ Bean-Method : SolrJ ( org.apache.solr : solr-solrj:5.4.1 ) uses the Apache HttpClient ( org.apache.httpcomponents : httpclient:4.4.1 ) . The HttpClient initializes the SSL context by using normal java classes like javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.In this way java loads the trustManager and analyzes all trusted certificates . If there is an error the certificate ( an instance of sun.security.x509.X509CertImpl ) is stored in a list and gets enriched by the thrown exception.This exception is swallowed and my application remains unaware.As far as I can see , the SSL Context is in the System / Root Classloader , my Application is in the dedicated WebappClassLoader and this is the problem because now there is an IOException inside of the SSL context which contains references in the stacktrace , backtrace and so on to classes in my application.But now I do n't know where this came from . Is it the SolrJ client , the Apache HttpClient , Java itself ( the JVM ) or is it my application ? I have made a small application to reproduce the problem which you can find here : https : //github.com/CptS/solrj-classloader-leakThis also contains a Workaround ( a shutdown hook which removes the references which leads to the classloader leak ) .If you disable the shutdown hook ( e.g . by commenting it out ) and start a clean Tomcat ( see `` Environment to reproduce '' below ) you can reproduce it by following this steps : deploy the war of the demo project ( A ) reload it ( B ) reload it again ( C ) Trigger GC ( D ) undeployTrigger GC ( E ) See that the metaspace gets not completly cleaned up ( F ) I 've create a heap dump and the shortest path to GC looks like this : This was the same as in my large application.The mentioned Workaround ( a little bit inspired by https : //github.com/mjiderhamn/classloader-leak-prevention , but this unfortunately does n't solve my problem ) searches by using reflection for these unparseableExtensions and removes the Exception stored in the why field through this way : SSLContextImpl.DefaultSSLContext # defaultImpl - > SSLContextImpl # trustManager - > X509TrustManager # trustedCerts - > X509CertImpl # info - > X509CertInfo # extensions - > CertificateExtensions # unparseableExtensions - > UnparseableExtension # whyBy doing this i 've got the stacktrace of the exception if it helps someone : My workaround solves the problem for now , but of course this is just a workaround.I want to know and maybe someone can answer one or more of my question : Is this a `` bug '' in SolrJ , HttpClient , Java or my application ? If it is my application , what I am doing wrong ? If it is not my application , is it a known problem ? I ca n't find any information about this . ( Where ) should I create a bug ticket ? Why is there a `` invalid '' certificate ? ( BTW : Maybe the leak would also be solve if I remove this certificate from the trust store ... I have n't tested but I think a invalid or damaged certificate should never lead to a classloader leak ... ) Has anyone some more information on this ?

"I have been reading the Java Language Spec , 3rd edition , and have found what I think is a discrepancy between the spec and the javac compiler implementation . The same discrepancies exist in the Eclipse compiler.Section 15.16 talks about cast expressions . It says that it should be a compile time error if the argument type can not be converted to the cast type via casting conversion ( section 5.5 ) : It is a compile-time error if the compile-time type of the operand may never be cast to the type specified by the cast operator according to the rules of casting conversion ( §5.5 ) . Otherwise , at run-time , the operand value is converted ( if necessary ) by casting conversion to the type specified by the cast operator.Section 5.5 talks about casting conversion . It gives a list of conversion types which are allowed . Specifically absent from the list is `` unboxing conversion followed by widening/narrowing primitive conversion '' . However that exact sequence of conversions does seem to be allowed by the javac compiler ( and also the Eclipse compiler ) . For instance : ... compiles just fine . ( The problematic cast is the cast to long ; the argument is of type java.lang.Integer , so the conversion requires unboxing to int followed by a widening primitive conversion ) .Likewise , according to the JLS it should not be possible to cast from byte to char , because that ( according to 5.1.4 ) requires a widening primitive conversion and a narrowing primitive conversion - however , this cast is also allowed by the compilers.Can anyone enlighten me ? Edit : since asking this , I have filed a bug report with Oracle . Their response is that this is a `` glitch in the JLS '' ."

"The task at hand is to create a part of my Java web application which will allow me to easily execute small pieces of codes in a compositionnal manner . The task at hand is to allow the user to compose `` actions '' in any order . What I 'm struggling with is passing parameters to my actions.All starts with the action interface : When the action is resolved , it 's code is executed . The code can be anything : calling a method in Java , executing some Javascript ... Here , the `` context '' is the problem for me . Each action executes within a specific context . The idea is that the user that creates the action can specify which object to retrieve from the concept , for example the user that is resolving the current action , or other objects specified in the action 's specific interface.Example , let 's look at this action : It 's a simple wrapper calling an action in Javascript using Nashorn . The parameters can be anything : objects with specific ids in the DB , int/String/boolean values configured by the user ... The code from an action can look like this : So the action can retrieve runtime parameters ( ex : user that executes the action ... ) and static parameters ( created when the action is loaded - from a config file for instance ) , and all that from the concept . Besides , the user can for example specify references to object in the parameters that will be injected at runtime.Actions can also be nested/decorated in order to achieve full compositionnality . For instance : This allows actions to be created easily : Knowing all this , what is the cleanest well to design the context class ? Should it be splitted into several elements ? The struggle is to inject everything needed to the class at runtime and be sure to not conflict with potential wrapped actions.The Context basic implementation is responsible for : retrieving any object from the DB at runtimeproviding static parameters to the action developpers holding a transaction and givingit access to the user merging runtime and static concept , and thiseven in a wrapper ( ex : if a parent action calls a child action , theuser that executes the action must still be known so context shouldmerge static child parameters and runtime parameters such as theuser ) I feel it is doing too much . The design is affected by the Concept classes owning much responsabilities and their should be fragmented ( right now every part of the application is linked to the concept ) . But how ? Here 's what I try to achieve in clean coding : the action interface should be kept simple ( 1 method max , with areasonnable number of parameters ) no usage of static mechanismsmaximum immutabilityIn a true object-oriented way , and method oriented , how to solve this specific design problem ? edit : removed public declarator in method in interfaceedit 2 : I had a lot of interesting solutions , but the one that made the more sense to me was the one in which each action is parametrized with a specific kind of Context.I reorganized things as such : Action interface has still only one method , to resolve the action with the contextStatic parameters of the actions , may they be DB or otherwise , are loaded when the action is created ( user session ) The context is just a facade for diverse operations ( transaction ... ) + specialized operations , like the user of the action"

"Let 's say that I have two classes ( Bob and Tom ) such that Bob uses Tom , but Tom does not require Bob . Both of these files are located in the same directory structure.If I attempt to compile Bob in the typical fashion , I can get it to implicitly compile Tom.java as well since it is recognized as a dependency of Bob.java . That works great . But now let 's say that I want to place Tom in a JAR file . So I build Tom.java and place the results into a JAR file : libTom.jar . I now compile with the classpath pointing at libTom.jar . Unfortunately , the compiler sees the Tom.java file and causes it to be compiled rather than using the class in libTom.jar . Is there a way to get the compiler to skip the implicit construction of Tom.java if the class is found in the classpath ? I recognize that this example is fairly contrived .

"Java 8 introduces a new default method on the List interface to sort it .

A list.sort ( null ) ; call would be transformed into list.sort ( Optional.empty ( ) ) ; .As it 's a method that it exposed to the outside world , I would find it more accurate.Why did n't they used the new Optional API instead ?"

"I would like to have a limited fixed catalogue of instances of a certain complex interface . The standard multiton pattern has some nice features such as lazy instantiation . However it relies on a key such as a String which seems quite error prone and fragile.I 'd like a pattern that uses enum . They have lots of great features and are robust . I 've tried to find a standard design pattern for this but have drawn a blank . So I 've come up with my own but I 'm not terribly happy with it.The pattern I 'm using is as follows ( the interface is highly simplified here to make it readable ) : This pattern has some very nice features to it : the enum implements the interface which makes its usage pretty natural : ComplexItem.ITEM1.method ( ) ; Lazy instantiation : if the construction is costly ( my use case involves reading files ) , it only occurs if it 's required.Having said that it seems horribly complex and 'hacky ' for such a simple requirement and overrides enum methods in a way which I 'm not sure the language designers intended.It also has another significant disadvantage . In my use case I 'd like the interface to extend Comparable . Unfortunately this then clashes with the enum implementation of Comparable and makes the code uncompilable.One alternative I considered was having a standard enum and then a separate class that maps the enum to an implementation of the interface ( using the standard multiton pattern ) . That works but the enum no longer implements the interface which seems to me to not be a natural reflection of the intention . It also separates the implementation of the interface from the enum items which seems to be poor encapsulation.Another alternative is to have the enum constructor implement the interface ( i.e . in the pattern above remove the need for the 'makeInstance ' method ) . While this works it removes the advantage of only running the constructors if required ) . It also does n't resolve the issue with extending Comparable.So my question is : can anyone think of a more elegant way to do this ? In response to comments I 'll tried to specify the specific problem I 'm trying to solve first generically and then through an example.There are a fixed set of objects that implement a given interfaceThe objects are stateless : they are used to encapsulate behaviour onlyOnly a subset of the objects will be used each time the code is executed ( depending on user input ) Creating these objects is expensive : it should only be done once and only if requiredThe objects share a lot behaviourThis could be implemented with separate singleton classes for each object using separate classes or superclasses for shared behaviour . This seems unnecessarily complex.Now an example . A system calculates several different taxes in a set of regions each of which has their own algorithm for calculting the taxes . The set of regions is expected to never change but the regional algorithms will change regularly . The specific regional rates must be loaded at run time via remote service which is slow and expensive . Each time the system is invoked it will be given a different set of regions to calculate so it should only load the rates of the regions requested.So : Recommended background reading : Mixing-in an Enum"

I tested two options : andWith both resulting in comparable performances.The action I use is implemented like this in playframework 2.1.x . SedisPool is my own object with extra Future wrapping of a normal sedis/jedis client pool.This performance-wize behave as good or slightly slower than the exact same function in Node.js , and Go . But still slower than Pypy . But way faster than the same thing in Java ( using blocking call to redis using jedis in this case ) . We load tested with gatling . We were doing a `` competition '' of techs for simple services on top of redis and the criteria was `` with the same amount of efforts from coders '' .I already tested this using fyrie ( and apart from the fact that I do not like the API ) it behaved almost the same as this Sedis implementation.But that 's beside my question .

So I now have more questions : - I tested 15x and 25x and 20 seems to be a sweet spot . Why ? Any ideas ? - Would there be other settings that might be better ? Other `` sweet spots '' ? - Is 20x the sweet spot or is this dependent on other parameters of the machine/jvm I am running on ? UPDATE - More docs on the subjectFound more information on the play framework docs.http : //www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.0/ThreadPoolsFor IO they do advise something to what I 've done but gives a way to do it through Akka.dispatchers that are configurable through *.conf files ( this should make my ops happy ) .So now I am using with the dispatcher configured byIt gave me around 5 % boost ( eyeballing it now ) , and more stability of the performance once the JVM was `` hot '' .

Here is what is repeated all over the place that I 'd like to just box into it 's own little corner : About the only way I 've thought to go around this is by passing a Method into a function which carries with it the try-catch logic and wrapping it all up in another function like so : but it looks ugly and carries with it a lot of boilerplate .

"I am currently working on developing a small Java application in which trusted code must be run alongside untrusted code . To accomplish this , I have installed a custom SecurityManager that throws SecurityExceptions any time a permission is checked.As a bridge between the trusted and untrusted code , I have a thread that uses Constructor.newInstance ( ) to instantiate an object of an untrusted type . At the time that it makes this call , the security manager is configured to block everything . Interestingly , the first 15 times that I try to create objects using Constructor.newInstance ( ) , everything works fine , but the 16th time I get a SecurityException.I 've managed to get this down to a simple test program : This program installs a SecurityManager whose checkPermission always throws an exception regardless of what permission is requested . It then sits in a loop and uses ctor.newInstance ( ) to instantiate a harmless Main object that prints out the number of instances generated so far . The output of this program , on my system , is as follows : According to the Javadoc for RuntimePermission , the createClassLoader permission is a risky one to grant : This is an extremely dangerous permission to grant . Malicious applications that can instantiate their own class loaders could then load their own rogue classes into the system . These newly loaded classes could be placed into any protection domain by the class loader , thereby automatically granting the classes the permissions for that domain.I have two questions : What specifically is causing this error ? Why is it that on the 16th time around , I get a request for a classloader ? I suspect this has to do with Java trying to optimize the reflection by generating bytecode to directly instantiate the object , but I 'm not sure.Without whitelisting the createClassLoader privilege , which is dangerous , is there a way to instantiate the untrusted objects from trusted code ? Am I fundamentally approaching this the wrong way ? Thanks !"

"BackgroundI 'm using wsimport to create what is essentially a Java webservice client , connecting to a .Net webservice that is returning datasets ( unfortunately ) . To be more specific I 'm working on a project ( inbound transport ) for the GeoEvent Processor suite of ESRI ArcGIS Server 10.2 , but I think this might be answered on more general terms in relation to JAXB and WSDL bindings . Bear with me as I have n't touched Java since college ( 10+ years ) . For purposes of the WSDL , the .Net DataSet is a polymorphic type whose actual layout is n't determined until run time , after the DataSet has been filled with data . This causes problems when you want to use that webservice with anything but .Net . After some research I 've managed to use wsimport to generate from the webservice wsdl . I was then able to put together a basic proof of concept program that gets results from the webservice as a DOM , then walks that DOM as a nodelist.Reference : JAX-WS error on WSDL file : `` Error resolving component 's : schema ' '' https : //weblogs.java.net/blog/vivekp/archive/2007/05/how_to_deal_wit_1.htmlThe section on Toolkit Bindings and figure 6 in http : //msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc188755.aspxMy wsimport looks like this ( domain names have been changed to protect the innocent ) : The ProblemUnfortunately , the same codebase that worked in my proof of concept , getting results from the webservice , fails once I implement in the ArcGIS GeoEvent Processor . My project is part of an OSGI bundle that the ArcGIS GeoEvent Processor will control . The error below is as shown in the Apache Karaf log for the GeoEvent Processor.Based on the error , my understanding is there is a problem with how I did the binding in wsimport , referencing the generic schema per those links I have listed above . Looks like the generic schema lacks definitions for some of the elements that exist as classes generated by wsimport . Those classes appear to be properly generated when I check the output from wsimport . I 've not included the WSDL due to posting limitations , but will include in later responses if needed.What I 'm trying to figure outHow should this error be interpreted ? Why does the same wsimport generated code used to access the webservice in my basic proof of concept fail when run in the ArcGIS GeoEvent Processor ? The error mentions JAXB and SAX , I 'm not consciously referencing either of those libraries in the proof of concept or the project for the ArcGIS GeoEvent Processor . Could it be that the binding/unmarshalling of the webservice is handled differently , with ArcGIS GeoEvent Processor wrapping in JAXB/SAX and the proof of concept not ? What can I do to resolve this ? Use a different , custom , xsd and xjb that spells out the expected schema for the webservice ? I 'm not sure exactly how that would be done . Use something other than wsimport to generate the webservice reference classes ? Tweak something in the java environment for the ArcGIS GeoEvent Processor ? Other options ? Commit seppuku , then it 's not my problem ? The ErrorThe Code ( snippet ) Environment SpecificsJDK 7u17 ( 1.7.0_17 ) 64 bit .

"I seem to stumble across something interesting in ArrayList implementation that I ca n't wrap my head around . Here is some code that shows what I mean : The idea is if you create an ArrayList like this : And look inside what the elementData ( Object [ ] where all elements are kept ) the it will report 10 . Thus you add one element - you get 9 additional slots that are un-used.If , on the other hand , you do : you add one element , space reserved is just for that element , nothing more . Internally this is achieved via two fields : When you create an ArrayList via new ArrayList ( 0 ) - EMPTY_ELEMENTDATA will be used.When you create an ArrayList via new Arraylist ( ) - DEFAULTCAPACITY_EMPTY_ELEMENTDATA is used.The intuitive part from inside me - simply screams `` remove DEFAULTCAPACITY_EMPTY_ELEMENTDATA '' and let all the cases be handled with EMPTY_ELEMENTDATA ; of course the code comment : We distinguish this from EMPTY_ELEMENTDATA to know how much to inflate when first element is addeddoes make sense , but why would one inflate to 10 ( a lot more than I asked for ) and the other one to 1 ( exactly as much as I requested ) .Even if you use List < String > zeroConstructorList = new ArrayList < > ( 0 ) , and keep adding elements , eventually you will get to a point where elementData is bigger than the one requested : But the rate at which it grows is smaller than the case of default constructor . This reminds me about HashMap implementation , where the number of buckets is almost always more than you asked for ; but there that is done because of the need for `` power of two '' buckets needed , not the case here though.So the question is - can someone explain this difference to me ?"

"I think that I already know the answer to that question , however , I would like to read your opinions to make sure that I really understand how java thread 's state machine ( or diagram ) works.Imagine that Thread A runs the notify ( ) just before return a given value : notify ( ) will be called before Thread A releases the lock ( that will occurs `` after '' the return 11 ; statement ) . So , how could a Thread B , that is waiting for this lock ( via wait ( ) method ) , acquire the lock that is still held by Thread A ? Note that , when thread B is notified the lock has not yet been released by Thread A.So what I think of this situation is the following : After calling wait ( ) , Thread B will change its state from Running to Waiting.After receiving the notification ( from Thread A notify ( ) method ) , Thread B will return from wait ( ) , change its state to Runnable and try to acquire the lock . Since the lock is not yet released by Thread A , Thread B will be blocked on the object 's monitor and pass its state from Runnable to Blocked.Eventually , after Thread A releases the lock , Thread B will acquire the lock and pass its state from Blocked to Running.Is this right ? What I want to understand with this question is what happens to a thread that returns from a wait ( ) which is synchronized by an already acquired lock ."

Setup / ProblemI 've create a custom Android module for Titanium to display Gif animations inside Ti .

"This is a well-known idiom in Java . See for instance this SO discussion . So basically to define an interface whereby classes that implement it need to have a method to compare with objects of their class you would do : ( Note : that 's apparently an unnecessarily complicated way to solve the particular use case - see this post - but I am inquiring on how to interpret the recursive syntax , never mind the particular application ) . In short , this is a recursive definition with no apparent end in the recursion and I do n't see how the compiler / type system pull this off . Also , trying to put in words ( `` an IComparable is a class whose instances can compare with objects of a class that implements the IComparable interface '' ) yields an illogical circular definition that ca n't be had in Philosophy / Logic / Mathematics but apparently is doable in compiler design ( ! ) .Further , it would seem that if the original idiom syntax is acceptable then one might also be allowed to say : ... but the compiler balks at that apparently allowing only one level of extend.Can anyone shed some light to help me grok this kind of recursive generic definitions ? UPDATEBased on the accepted answer ( BartoszKP ) what I think I now understand is the following : The `` recursive '' definition should NOT be read as ( arrows representing the `` the definition depends on '' relationship ) : ... which is illogical ( circular ) , but rather as : ... which is not illogical and thus doable in the compiler . So , in words , the definition of IComparable is given in terms of the list of methods it defines and the bound it defines on type T and the latter in turn also depends on the list of methods . So , no recursion ."

"One thing I 've run into a few times is a service class ( like a JBoss service ) that has gotten overly large due to helper inner classes . I 've yet to find a good way to break the class out . These helpers are usually threads . Here 's an example : So , what can happen if I have a couple helpers and they 're at all complex , is the overall class file can get really large . I like the inner classes in that it makes clear the classes are wholly owned by the service and exist only to help that service . I 've tried breaking the classes out and passing the parent service as a reference , which works mostly , but things I do n't like are : I end up exposing package level accessors so the broken out classes can get to the variables , whereas before I did n't expose the setters at all since the inner classes had direct access . Plus , things get a bit more wordy as I 'm constantly calling accessors rather than the underlying variables . A minor nit , granted . Convenience methods ( e.g . checkAssetIsValid ( ) or some such ) need package level exposure now so the helper classes can call them , where as before as inner classes they could be private . Even worse , I need to pass the service implementation class to the helper classes constructors since I do n't want to expose these helpers methods in the interface the service implements because that forces them to be public . This can create some unit test/mocking issues . Worse yet , any synchronization I wanted to do gets leaked out through some external convenience method ( e.g . lockDownAssets ( ) during a poller update ) . Before , the internal classes had access to private Locks.So , in short , breaking the classes out loses some of the encapsulation I like . But leaving them in can lead to some large java files . I 've yet to find a good way to deal with this . C++ had the concept of `` friends '' which I 've rarely missed , but would actually help in this case.Thoughts ?"

"At my job we have a DSL for specfying mathematical formulas , that we later apply to a lot of points ( in the millions ) .As of today , we build an AST of the formula , and visit each node to produce what we call an `` Evaluator '' . We then pass that evaluator the arguments of the formula , and for each point it does the computing.For instance , we have that formula : x * ( 3 + y ) Our evaluator will emit `` Evaluate '' objects for each step.This method is easy to program , but not very efficient . So I started looking into method handles to build up a `` composed '' method handle to speed things up lately . Something along this : I have my `` Arithmetic '' class with : And when building my AST I use MethodHandles.lookup ( ) to directly get a handle on those and compose them . Something along these lines , but in a tree : Sadly , I 'm quite disapointed by the results . For instance , the actual construction of the method handle is very long ( due to calls to MethodHandles : :insertArguments and other such compositions functions ) , and the added speedup for evaluation only starts to make a difference after over 600k iterations.At 10M iterations , the Method handle starts to really shine , but millions of iterations is not ( yet ? ) a typical use case . We are more around 10k-1M , where the result is mixed.Also , the actual computation is sped up , but by not so much ( ~2-10 times ) .

Do you know how ? lambdas and method handles are quite interconnected , and I 'm not sure that I will get a significant speedup . I see these results for simple lambdas : direct : 0,02s , lambda : 0,02s , mh : 0,35s , reflection : 0,40 but what about composed lambdas ? Thanks guys !"

"I am working on an android app that loads in a list of students to display in a list based activity . There are two components to the app . There is a server which responds via xml with the list of current active students and a database on the app end which stores theses students with some details ( name , age etc ) . I would like a way to sync these two data sources . When the app starts , I would like to check against the xml to see if students on the server were added/deleted and update the db accordingly.I would be parsing the xml list into a student object at login . Is there any way to store/retrieve an entire object into an android supported db so I can do a direct comparison to see what to update/delete ? It would end up being something like What is the most efficient/lightweight way to achieve object persistance and then comparison in Android ?"

"I 'll first quickly motivate the question with my use case . My library needs to expose a Java exception classifier to a framework which it plugs in to . For example : Sometimes , and for reasons out of my control , the passed exception is a wrapper around the one I 'm interested in so I want to search the cause chain for it . My initial idea was : Unfortunately , this could result in infinite recursion if the passed exception has a cycle in its causal chain . It 's highly unlikely that such an exception will be passed , and an argument could be made that it 's an error elsewhere in the system if such an exception is created , but I 'm very uncomfortable with having the possibility of my library being responsible for a production outage if it happens . Throwable 's API and javadoc do not explicitly forbid this possibility beyond the idea that cycles are inherently nonsensical in a causal chain.I noticed that Guava has a @ Beta method to extract the causal chain , Throwables.getCausalChain , but its implementation is susceptible to the same issue -- it will wind up throwing an OOME.I 'm planning to use an identity hash set to detect the cycle and mitigate the risk , but I wanted to hear how others view this issue . Do you think I 'm being overly defensive ? What would you do ?"

"I 've been reading up on type classes in Scala and thought I had a good grasp on it , until I remembered Java 's java.util.Comparator.If I understand properly , Ordering is the prototypical example of a type class . The only difference I can think of between a Comparator and an instance of Ordering is that comparators are necessarily explicit , while orderings can be , and often are , implicit.Is Comparator a type class ? I get the ( mistaken ? ) impression that Java does not actually have type classes . Does this mean that a type class needs to be able to be implicit ? I considered implicit conversions of type classes to be mostly syntactic sugar - awesome as it is , it 's `` simply '' giving the compiler enough hint - was I missing something ? The following code example shows how Comparator adds an ordering operation to a type that did n't have it , without having to modify said type ."

"I want to create an iterator class which allows me to iterate through lists with generic types ( e.g . lst1 integer , lst2 string ) one item after another.For this I have to consider the following given situation.The interface is a generic Iterator .

"The java.lang.Double.parseValue method handles strangely-crafted representations of doubles in an inconsistent way.If you write a very large number , so large that it is outside of double 's range , but then append a large negative exponent to bring it back in range , you end up in range ( illustrated here in Scala 's REPL ) : On the other hand , if you write a very tiny number , so small that it is outside of double 's range , but then use a large positive exponent to bring it back in range , it only works if the exponent itself is not too large : Is this simply a bug , or is there a spec somewhere that allows this behavior , or are all of these allowed by spec to fail and one should just thank one 's blessings when one gets the correct result ?

"I 'm developing an applet that behaves strangely : this is not the usual `` I ca n't start my applet in the browser '' problem , but something more subtle . The applet consists into a jtabbedpane with 8 tabs , each of which does some data manipulation in the workflow , and the user has two buttons ( back and forward ) to cycle through tabs.When I run it into the browser ( latest chrome or firefox , but this does n't matter ) I notice a consistent slowdown when passing from the 7th to the 8th tab : in the latter I put a jtable with a custom tablemodel in that tab and in eclipse it runs just fine . A few debug steps later I notice that the jvm throws a classnotfoundexception for the class RateTableModel , which is my custom tablemodel . The odd thing is that even though I test the applet both in the IDE and as a self signed applet into the browser that exception is never thrown in any console . I verified everywhere : there are no empty catch blocks , every exception gets always its stackstrace printed and if I put the initialization code of my tablemodel in a try/catch block that exception never gets caught . The even funnier thing is that after a random amount of time the execution continues as if nothing happened ( only in the IDE this time ) , whereas in the browser the GUI acts just like a normal exception : it messes everything up.What I would like to ask is for any idea on why this happens.The class RateTableModel is located in the package geotel.utils , where I have other classes I regularly instantiate before I have to load this one , and I verified that this class is present in the jar.Details on the development ( maybe for those who read this can be useful ) : The applet is signed using the commandthe applet is run from the following html file : The JNLP file is the following : The code that causes the ClassNotFoundException is the following : class DatiRatePaneland the definition of the class RateTableModel isEDIT : after a few more debug steps , I found that in the debug view there is the situation in the screenshotI absolutely have no idea what those keys stand for , but if I keep pressing F5 ( Step into ) those keys go away , the very following step the execution continues and the classloader magically becomes able to find the class RateTableModel . How can I get rid of this ? Thank you ! EDIT2 : I researched a bit on the keys icons in the Eclipse documentation , and it found out they are monitors on locked objects . As far as I know monitors appear where there are synchronized blocks of code , which I do n't have here ( and I 'm sure those blocks are n't called ) . It 's getting me mad ...

In a Fragment should you call getActivity ( ) each time you need a reference to the activity or create a global variable 'mActivity ' and use this.Basically you already have an Activity object ( getActivity ( ) ) and it feels like creating a global ( mActivity ) is code duplication and creating an extra reference that is unneeded.But also using getActivity ( ) everywhere looks horrid and feels wrong doing multiple method call 's each time ( performance ? ) .This would also be relevant for getApplication ( ) or getView ( ) ; I 've read through Coding for Performance but ca n't see anything relevant .

"There is an option in java web applications to handle exceptions by defining error-page in web.xml : I am wondering if there could potentially be a problem with defining a JSP error page ( as opposed to an HTML error page ) .Because JSPs run at server side .

Specifically I mean that whatever controls the redirecting to the error-page defined in web.xml still works , but the actual rendering of the JSP does n't work for some reason ( something throws an exception ) .I did n't actually see a problem like this , but I wonder if it 's possible .

"Based on our experiments we see that stateful Spark Streaming internal processing costs take significant amount of time when state becomes more than a million of objects . As a result latency suffers , because we have to increase batch interval to avoid unstable behavior ( processing time > batch interval ) .It has nothing to do with specifics of our app , since it can be reproduced by code below.What are exactly those Spark internal processing/infrastructure costs that take it so much time to handle user state ? Is there any options to decrease processing time besides of simply increasing batch interval ? We planned to use state extensively : at least 100MB or so on a each of a few nodes to keep all data in memory and only dump it once in hour.Increasing batch interval helps , but we want to keep batch interval minimal.The reason is probably not space occupied by state , but rather large object graph , because when we changed list to large array of primitives , the problem gone.Just a guess : it might has something to do with org.apache.spark.util.SizeEstimator used internally by Spark , because it shows up while profiling from time to time.Here is simple demo to reproduce the picture above on modern iCore7 : less than 15 MB of stateno stream input at allquickest possible ( dummy ) 'updateStateByKey ' functionbatch interval 1 secondcheckpoint ( required by Spark , must have ) to local disktested both locally and on YARNCode :"

"Some time ago I wrote a little image viewer/processing program with Java , a mini-Photoshop , if you will . I wanted there to be a drop-down menu where I could select which one of the images I have opened would be `` on the table '' , ie . shown and methods applied to . I wanted the name of the image to be the name of the JMenuItem shown in the menu . I also wanted a new button to appear when I add a new image.I wondered this for some time and finally produced this solution , a new class that handles the creation of the new button when an image is added . The code is as follows : This works as it should . For this site I translated the original Finnish names to English , wonder why I wrote them in Finnish originally ...

If I have two buttons on my interface and I want them to do different things , I need two inner classes , one for each , each having its own inner implementation of the interface ActionListener .

If I resize the window , it does n't fix the issue , it only fixes when one of the sliders triggers repaint on the DrawPane ...

"I am implementing a simple version of the Cluedo game.There are 3 types of cards in the game , Character , Weapon and Room .

Rather I had three enums in my game which are : However there is one case where three types of cards are put together and dealt evenly to each player of the game .

"I give lessons on the fundamentals of the Java programming language , to students who study this subject in college.Today one of them got me really confused with her question , so I told her to give me just a day to think about the problem , and I 'll give her as accurate of an answer as I can.She told me that the teacher got really angry when she used the keyword instanceof in her exam.Also , she said that the teacher said that there is not a way to prove how polymorphism worked if she used that word.I thought a lot to try to find a way to prove that in some occasions we need to use instanceof , and also that even if we use it , there still some polymorphism in that approach.So this is the example I made : My conclusions are the following : The first approach ( APPROACH 1 ) is a simple demo of how to program to an interface , not a realization . I think that the polymorphism is clearly visible , in the parameters of the method makeItTalk ( Animal animal ) , and also in the way the method talk is called , by using the animal object . ( This part is ok ) The second part is the one that makes me confused . She used instanceof at some point in her exam ( I do n't know how their exam looked like ) , and that was not accepted correctly because the teacher said , you are not proving polymorphism.To help her understand when she can use instanceof , I thought about telling her , that she can use it , when the method she needs to call is not in the interface , but it is just in one of the implementing classes.As you can see , only cats can climb to trees , and it would not be logical to make a Hippopotamus or a Dog climb to a tree . I think that could be an example of when to use instanceofBut what about polymorphism in approach 2 ? How many uses of polymorphism do you see there ( only approach 2 ) ? Do you think this line has some type of polymorphism in it ? ( ( Cat ) animal ) .climbToATree ( ) ; I think it does , because in order to achieve a Casting of this type , the objects need to have an IS-A relationship , an in some way that is polymorphism.What do you think , is it correct ? If yes , how would you explain with your own words , that casting relies on polymorphism ?"

Third-party tools like Javassist are OK but it must be `` guaranteed '' or at least `` guaranteed under specific conditions '' .Is there any specific Java implementation that does guarantee order on Class.getDeclaredFields ( ) ( perhaps under specific conditions ( which ones ) ) ? For your information , I need the source order to reconstruct behavior of a legacy language where order was important . I do n't like adding order explicitly e.g . by adding arrays or annotations , as I want to keep the source as readable as possible. -- edit -- An important note may be that the fields I need to `` traverse '' will all be annotated , e.g . @ MyComplexType ( len = 4 ) .

"Imagine a Person class with a boolean flag indicating whether or not the person is employable - set to false by default.Now imagine having some external boolean methods which act on Person objects . For example , consider static boolean methods in a utility class.Boolean static methods are in essence analogous to boolean valued functions i.e . predicates . We can construct a 2^ ( # predicates ) -by- # predicates truth table out of predicates . For example , given three predicates : ofWorkingAge , ofGoodCharacter , isQualified we can construct the following 8-by-3 truth table : We now want to employ people with desirable qualities . Let + indicate that we wish to consider somebody employable ( i.e . set their employability flag to true ) and - the opposite.Now imagine having a collection of Person objects . For each person we adjust their employability flag according to the three predicates . We also update a count ( this forces us to use the entire truth table instead of just the positives ) , so that given 1,000 people we want to end up with something like : Presumably this can be thought of as filtering with truth tables . Setting employability flags and updating counts is a rather contrived example but you can easily see how we might instead want to set and update much more complicated things . QUESTIONIs there a way of elegantly doing this ? I can think of two solutions : Clunky solutionHave a giant hand coded if , else if , else chain . This is just bad.Slightly smarter solutionPass predicates ( perhaps in an array ) and a collection of sentences to a method . Let the method generate the corresponding truth table . Loop over the people , set their employability , and return an array of counts . I can see how things could be done with functional interfaces . This SO answer is potentially relevant . You could change PrintCommand to IsQualified and pass callCommand a Person instead of a string . But this also seems kindah clunky because we 'd then have to have a new interface file for every predicate we come up with . Is there any other Java 8-ish way of doing this ?"

So what I would need is either : Have a way for the ListView to not scroll automatically to the top when the subviews are being layed out again or A way to focus my EditText after having called ListView.setSelected ( ) or 3 . Have another way to scroll the ListView that will not clear focus from the EditText.For option I have tried scrollTo ( ) and smoothScrollToPosition ( ) . scrollTo for some reason works but hides certain items from the ListView ( they become invisible , not loaded ) . And smoothScrollToPosition ( ) creates an animation where the ListView jumps to the top and then it brings the user back to the Item ( and does it 2 or 3 times ) ."

ExampleHere is a simple example where there are two variables A and B , both referring to ONE . The value of value is negated before B is used for the first time .

"I ca n't understand how the EJB container manage thread-safety for @ Stateless beans with instance variables . So I will give a simple example before explaining my concerns : Here is my questions , assuming that our container supports pooling:1 . Pooling vs Thread-safe : User 1 used an instance of BeanTest and modified the var using the modify method , then he finished and the container put the instance of BeanTest in the managed pool . When User 2 tries to use the same bean for a request , he might get the same instance of BeanTest intially modified by User 1 ( I understand that might get another instance too ) . So which state of the instance variable var he will find ( default value which is null or `` TestName '' ) ? if its the new modified one , do that mean that even @ Stateless beans are not 100 % thread-safe ? So finnaly there is no container added -value regarding thread safety , as not using instance variable makes a bean thread safe even if it 's not a @ Stateless bean2 . Pooling vs @ PreDestroyIf the bean is returned to the managed pool and not destroyed , do that mean that the @ Predestroy method will not be called and in that case the connection will stay opened ? So , if we have 30 inctance of that bean in the pool , we may have 30 open connection that is not used , is n't that a performance issue ? or this not how @ Predestroy is working conbined with pooling ? ( using Connection is just an example , we may have other kind of ressource that we need to close in @ Predestroy ) NB : This is not a real life example , so I'am not looking for an alternative solution , my concern is to understand the whole concept and how things are managed in the Application Server , what is happening under the hood"

"The Java Language Specification for Java 8 provides an example of a method call with a type argument in `` Example 4.11-1 .

For example : I have a couple of questions arising : Can anyone suggest a valid reason for Java allowing these redundant type parameters ? Accepting that they do no harm , it still seems to me like something that the compiler could and should catch.That code only compiles if the method calls with type arguments are prefixed with `` this. '' . Otherwise you get `` illegal start of expression '' errors . Is that a bug ? Should n't any unambiguous method call that works with `` this . '' also work without `` this. '' ?

"First , some context : I have a TreeView in my JavaFX application , with a custom TreeCell implementation . This implementation adds a HBox to display a label ( using LabeledText ) and one ( or more ) icons / status indicators to the right.The label and icons also get tooltips attached to them . When inspected with Scenic View , the result is something like this : As you can see in the image above , a cell contains a HBox with the label ( LabeledText ) , spacing region , and in this example one icon ( using a font hence the Glyph+LabeledText ) . More icons might be added using either a font or at some point maybe images.Depending on the status of the item represented , I want to style the label differently ( eg different text color , italics , ... ) . The resulting TreeView currently looks like this : Actual question : I have tried a couple of variants of my approach , but the logical solution does n't work properly even though it seems it should . Am I missing something ? Have I perhaps discovered a bug in JavaFX CSS handling ? I have a workaround which currently works ( but may cease to do so if I add certain features to my TreeView ) so I would still like to know why this does n't work as expected.Basic approachDepending on the item displayed and it 's status , apply relevant CSS classes to the TreeCell . Using CSS selectors , style the inner label . For example : The issue I have is that the CSS selection of children of a TreeCell seems not to work reliably once the user starts manipulating the TreeView in the UI . CSS gets applied to nodes which do not match the given CSS rules . For example , after expanding/collapsing some items , labels which do not match the CSS selectors get italicised anyway.So , if you look at the image above and suppose that is a correct display for my items . Collapsing/reopening the Item 1-node might result in , say Item 3 suddenly becoming italicised even though no such CSS was ever added to that node.I verified the applied classes using Scenic View to ensure I was setting/clearing classes properly : there are LabeledText nodes inside a CustomTreeCellImpl without the mystatus class that still get italicised.Alternative 1 : using pseudoclasses instead of regular classesSame issue as the basic approach aboveExample CSS : Alternative 2 : apply classes or pseudoclasses directly to LabeledText instead of TreeCellSame issue as the basic approach aboveExample CSS : Alternative 3 : directly apply CSS properties to the created label through codeAgain , this runs into the same issue as before : after manipulating the tree , styles get applied where they shouldn't.Here is the relevant part of the method that populates/updates the TreeCell : The LabeledText object never has its text changed : a new one is always created . Even then I get incorrect results.This strikes me as especially odd as this has nothing to do with CSS selectors any more - style is applied directly to the node , but the problem still persists.The workaroundFor those who are interested in how I managed to work around the problem - for now : apply classes or pseudoclasses to the entire TreeCell , and add exceptions/overrides for child elements I do not want styled to restore default layout.This mostly works but might become cumbersome if/when I add more elements to the cells . Also , I speculate this only works because here all the child elements ( aside from the label ) have the exact same style applied , regardless of the status of the item they are displaying ( eg all Glyphs are black normal font , etc ) .If/when I want to customize the style of these ( eg change Glyph color depending on context , instead of just using different Glyph characters ) , I speculate I may again run into this issue - this time with no clue how to solve it as my workaround will no longer be applicable.Update : I put a project on GitHub which demonstrates the issue.The demo data in the project is supposed to put items 1.1 and 1.3 in italics , with all others shown normal . When expanding/collapsing item 1 , items which should n't get italicised anyway ( on Windows ) .Also , when creating this example I noticed that on OS X none of the items get italicised ( the CSS itself gets loaded properly , a different style I added temporarily to test did get applied ) . On Windows , the issue as described above happens ."

"I write a 2D platformer game where I need rooms with ( maximum 4 ) doors . I write it in Java , but the language is irrelevant.Each room can have 4 doors , on the top , bottom and sides . I call them NORTH , SOUTH , EAST and WEST . When I 'm building a room , I only give it an integer , where each bit in the integer is representing a door . For example if I want a room with 3 doors ( one on the North , one on the East , and on on the west ) i give the room the number : 11 ( 1011 in binary ) .For this reason each door has an integer , identifying it.If I generate a room , I give it the combination of these identifiers.For example : the previously mentioned room would get the identifierI store these doors in a simple array : My problem is : I need a function which can map the identifiers to the correct index in the array . I do n't always need 4 doors.What I did at first seems the simplest : the doors array would always have 4 elements , and the indices I would not use would simply remain nulls . In order to be safe I needed to to determine if the door I 'm requesting actually exists in the room.So with this , the query function looked like this : Which was working . BUT ! This way the array could waste space with the unused elements . Plus the class Door could potentially be any size , increasing the memory waste.Not to mention I could need more `` slots '' for doors ( for example , If I try to implement this in 3D ) , so I decided to try and make the doors array 's size depending on the identifier for the doors : Which gave an IndexOutOfBounds error real quick . I was n't surprised , because the doors array could be any size from 0 to 4 , so I needed a new hashing method.What I came up with are two hash tables , one for the array indices : and one , which helps helps in the mapping of the previous table : so my current mapping function looks like this : Which also seems to work fine , but I feel there 's a simpler solution to this problem , or one with less wasteful hash tables . I feel this is n't as asymptotically flexible as it should be , or I am over-complicating things . What would be a better method ? Thank you for your time !"

Today I stumbled about some strange inner ( non-static ) class behaviour.If I have the following classes ... ... everything seems to be clear . The instance of InnerB belongs to the instance of B so if it should output val it prints the already replaced value 'new'.BUT if the inner class extends the outer class this does n't work.If I have a look at the constructors I also see that a new instance of B will be created if instance of InheritedB is created.I find this very strange ... Can somebody explain why there is this difference ?

"A recent debate within my team made me wonder .

What I would cover from this is only a single happy-unhappy path where the execution returns from the last line , just to see if I put these stuff together it wo n't blow up.The problem is that it is not that easy to tell why did the test result in false , and that makes some of the guys feeling uneasy about it ( e.g. , if we simply check only the return value , it is hidden that the test is green because someone changed the validation and it returns false ) . Sure , yeah , we can cover all cases but that would be a heavy overkill imho.Does anyone has a good rule of thumb for this kind of issues ? Or a recommendation ? Reading ? Talk ? Blog post ? Anything on the topic ? Thanks a lot in advance ! PS : Sry for the ugly example but it 's quite hard to translate a specific code part to an example .

"I have to write a java program that receives G-Code commands via network and sends them to a 3D printer via serial communication . In principle everything seems to be okay , as long as the printer needs more than 300ms to execute a command . If execution time is shorter than that , it takes too much time for the printer to receive the next command and that results in a delay between command execution ( printer nozzle standing still for about 100-200ms ) . This can become a problem in 3d printing so i have to eliminate that delay.For comparison : Software like Repetier Host or Cura can send the same commands via seial without any delay between command execution , so it has to be possible somehow.I use jSerialComm library for serial communication.This is the Thread that sends commands to the printer : this is printer.serialWrite : ( `` Inspired '' by Arduino Java Lib ) printer is an Object of class Printer which implements com.fazecast.jSerialComm.SerialPortDataListenerrelevant functions of PrinterPrinter.bufferAvailable is declared volatileI also tried blocking functions of jserialcomm in another thread , same result.Where is my bottleneck ? Is there a bottleneck in my code at all or does jserialcomm produce too much overhead ? For those who do not have experience in 3d-printing : When the printer receives a valid command , it will put that command into an internal buffer to minimize delay . As long as there is free space in the internal buffer it replies with ok . When the buffer is full , the ok is delayed until there is free space again.So basicly you just have to send a command , wait for the ok , send another one immediately ."

"Suppose I have a simple interface representing a complex number , whose instances would be immutable . For the sake of brevity , I omitted the obvious plus , minus , times and divide methods that would simply create and return a new immutable instance.Now the question is , what would the best way to implement this as an immutable class ? The most simple and straightforward `` I care about performance only when it 's a problem '' approach would be to store the real and imaginary parts as final fields and compute the absolute value and angle on every invocation of those methods . This keeps the class small and simple , but obviously the last two methods return the same result every time.So why not save the absolute value and angle into a field upon creation ? Well , obviously the memory footprint of the class is now a bit larger and also , counting the the results for every instance created may be also contra productive if these two methods are called seldom.A third possibility I came up with is to compute the absolute value and angle lazily , on the first time they are required . But as you can see , this makes the code a bit cluttered and error prone . Also , I 'm not sure if the use of volatile modifier is actually correct in this context.So my question is , which of these three approaches is the best ? Is there some other even better approach ? Should I care about performance at all and stay with the first approach and think about optimizations only when performance becomes a real problem ?"

It seems to be working fine ( Version : 4.9Build id : I20180801-2000 ) .In JDK 11 there is a new override of method toArray ( ) in Java.util.Collection : It is a default method , but it is not overriden . All it does is pass the value returned by the supplied generator function ( using a hard-coded argument of zero ) to another override of toArray ( ) which then returns the content of the Collection as an array.As described in the Javadoc for that method , it can be called like this : That works fine , and an array of String of the appropriate length , corresponding to the Collection < String > , is returned.The Javadoc also states that `` the default implementation calls the generator function with zero and then passes the resulting array to toArray ( T [ ] ) '' .If I provide my own generator function it does get called ( as shown by the println ( ) console output ) , but the return value of its apply ( ) method seems to be ignored . It 's as though I had called toArray ( String [ ] : :new ) regardless of the content of the array returned by my generator function.Here 's the MCVE : Here 's the console output produced by running the MCVE : array1 : [ This , is , a , list , of , strings ] intFunc : sz : 0 intFunc : array to be returned : [ A , B , C ] array2 : [ This , is , a , list , of , strings ] intFunc : sz : 4 intFunc : array to be returned : [ A , B , C , D ] array3 : [ This , is , a , list , of , strings ] The output shows that it does n't matter what my generator function does - the array it returns is not used.My question is how do I get this new implementation of toArray ( ) to use the array returned by my generator function , or am I attempting something that is not possible ? Update based on comments and the answer from Nicolai : The problem with my sample code was not with the generator , but with my test cases . They happened to cause the generator to return an array with fewer elements than the collection , so a new array was allocated instead , to hold exactly the number of elements in the collection.A test case that returns an array larger than the collection works as expected . For example this code : gives the following console output : intFunc : sz : 9 intFunc : array to be returned : [ A , B , C , D , E , F , G , H , I ] array4 : [ This , is , a , list , of , strings , null , H , I ] The SO question Collections emptyList/singleton/singletonList/List/Set toArray explains why there is a null value within the returned array ."

"I am trying to understand how ReentrantLock works in java.Lets consider a simple example below : I was trying to figure out the call hierarchy of lock ( ) method.For FairSync : For NonFairSync : Both lock ( ) methods call acquire ( ) method with argument as 1.In AbstractQueuedSynchronizer class : If current thread can not acquire a resource ( i.e . some another thread has acquired this resource ) , then current thread has to wait . In this case ReentrantLock calls selfInterrupt ( ) method.Now my question is how interrupt ( ) method can stop a thread which is equivalent to wait ( ) method in synchronized ? Also , after the resource has been released by another thread , how currentThread start automatically ? ( After calling unlock ( ) method by another thread which is internally calling sync.release ( 1 ) ; ) I also tried to figure out how interrupt ( ) method works from here but unable to find answer to my questions ."

"I am attempting to filter/reduce a stream of data that has some duplicated entries in it.In essence , I attempting to find a better solution to filtering a set of data than what I implemented . We have data that , at its base , are something like this : I need to extract the details such that : Only action 5 is selectedIf a detail is the same ( e.g , D6 appears twice on different days ) , the earliest date is selectedThese data are loaded into Objects ( one instance for each `` record '' ) , and there are other fields on the Object but they are not relevant for this filtering . The Detail is stored as a String , the Date as a ZonedDateTime , and the Action is an int ( well , actually an enum , but here shown as an int ) . The Objects are given in a List < Entry > in chronological order.I was able to get a working , but what I consider to be suboptimal , solution by doing : But the issue is I had to use this pass ( ) method and in it checking a Set < String > to maintain whether a given Detail had alreay been processed . While this approach works , it seems like it should be possible to avoid an external reference.I tried to use a groupingBy on the Detail , and it would allow extracting the earliest entry from the list , the problem was I no longer had a date ordering and I had to process the resultant Map < String , List < Entry > > .It seems like some reduce operation ( if I used that term correctly ) here without the use of the pass ( ) method should be possible , but I am struggling to get a better implementation.What would be a better approach such that the .filter ( e - > pass ( e , update ) ) could be removed ?

"From Socket documentation : shutdownInput Places the input stream for this socket at `` end of stream '' . Any data sent to the input stream side of the socket is acknowledged and then silently discarded . If you read from a socket input stream after invoking shutdownInput ( ) on the socket , the stream will return EOF.In order to test interaction between clients in a server , I 've written some client bots.These bots generate somewhat random client requests . Since these only write to the server , they have no need for the input stream , they do not need to read the updates the server sends . This is the main body of code for the bots : If I uncomment the shutdownInput , an exception is thrown in the server 's client handler : Connection resetI was n't expecting an exception to be thrown on the other side of the socket . The documentation suggests ( to me , at least ) that anything sent by the other side will just be silently discarded , causing no interference with the other end 's activity , ie without having the other side throw an exception.Can I just ignore what the server sends , or should I drain what comes to the input stream ? Is there any automagic way of doing it , or do I need to regularly read and ignore ?"
When we sayit prints class java.lang.Integerwhich makes sense because java.lang.Integer is a class . So we can have a corresponding Class object.But when I doit prints int which I felt is kind of ambiguous as .class returns an object of type Class and int is not a class ( but a primitive type ) . What is the motive behind allowing .class operation on primitive types when there is no such class ( primitiveType.class.getName ( ) ) present ? Also if you see toString ( ) method of class Class As primitive types are not classes or interfaces it simply print the name ( int for int ) . So why allow creating Class objects of a class which is not present ?
I was testing out the new HttpClient from Java 11 and came across the following behaviour : I am making two Async requests to a public REST API for testing and tried it with one client and two separate requests . This process did n't throw any exceptions.Then I tried refactoring the HttpClient into a method and I got the following exception when it tried to make the second request : This produces the following exception after succesfully executing the first request and failing at the second one : I tried passing separate clients and requests via parameters in the method as well but it produced the same result .

"I 'm currently experimenting with the Google 's guice inversion of control container . I previously had singletons for just about any service ( database , active directory ) my application used . Now I refactored the code : all the dependencies are given as parameters to constructors . So far , so good . Now the hardest part is with the graphical user interface . I face this problem : I have a table ( JTable ) of products wrapped in an ProductFrame . I give the dependencies as parameters ( EditProductDialog ) .The problem is that guice ca n't know what Product I have selected in the table , so it ca n't know what to inject in the EditProductDialog.Dependency Injection is pretty viral ( if I modify one class to use dependency injection I also need to modify all the other classes it interacts with ) so my question is should I directly instantiate EditProductDialog ? But then I would have to pass manually the DBProductController to the EditProductDialog and I will also need to pass it to the ProductFrame and all this boils down to not using dependency injection at all.Or is my design flawed and because of that I ca n't really adapt the project to dependecy injection ? Give me some examples of how you used dependency injection with the graphical user interface.All the examples found on the Internet are really simple examples where you use some services ( mostly databases ) with dependency injection ."

"I 'm working on a game , and in it I want growth to happen exponentially - so , for example , getting from 2 to 3 people might take around the same time as getting from 2 million to 3 million people .

Brute forcing did n't work ; I have to be able to solve all given grids in < = 2000ms .

"Forgive me if this question is primarily opinion based , but I have the feeling that it is not and there is a good reason for the choice . So , here 's an example . Sorry , it 's really long , but super simple : Interface : Implementing class 1 : Implementing class 2 : Driver : This works since .area ( ) is overridden by Circle and Square . Now , here 's where my question truly begins . Let 's say that the driver has these methods : If we call : This happens because Java interprets the objects as Shapes and not Circle and Square . Of course we can get the desired results through : Now that we have a background my question is : What reasons contributed to the compiler/language design such that whatIs ( shapes [ 0 ] ) ; will print `` Shape ? '' As in , why can the Java compiler accurately distinguish between overridden methods for related objects , but not overloaded methods ? More specifically , if the only methods that the driver has access to are : and we attempt to call , we will get two errors ( one for Square and one for Circle ) indicating that : method Driver.whatIs ( Square ) is not applicable actual argument Shape can not be converted to Square by method invocation conversion So , again , now that we 've gotten to the nitty-gritty , why can Java not handle a situation like this ? As in , is this done due to efficiency concerns , is it just not possible due to the some design decisions , is this a bad practice for some reason , etc ?"

"I 'm developing a real time strategy game clone on the Java platform and I have some conceptional questions about where to put and how to manage the game state . The game uses Swing/Java2D as rendering . In the current development phase , no simulation and no AI is present and only the user is able to change the state of the game ( for example , build/demolish a building , add-remove production lines , assemble fleets and equipment ) . Therefore , the game state manipulation can be performed in the event dispatch thread without any rendering lookup . The game state is also used to display various aggregated information to the user.However , as I need to introduce simulation ( for example , building progress , population changes , fleet movements , manufacturing process , etc . ) , changing the game state in a Timer and EDT will surely slow down the rendering . Lets say the simulation/AI operation is performed in every 500ms and I use SwingWorker for the computation of about 250ms in length . How can I ensure , that there is no race condition regarding the game state reads between the simulation and the possible user interaction ? I know that the result of the simulation ( which is small amount of data ) can be efficiently moved back to the EDT via the SwingUtilities.invokeLater ( ) call.The game state model seems to be too complex to be infeasible for just using immutable value classes everywhere.Is there a relatively correct approach to eliminate this read race condition ? Perhaps doing a full/partial game state cloning on every timer tick or change the living space of the game state from EDT into some other thread ? Update : ( from the comments I gave ) The game operates with 13 AI controlled players , 1 human player and has about 10000 game objects ( planets , buildings , equipment , research , etc. ) . A game object for example has the following attributes : In a scenario , the user builds a new building onto this planet . This is performed in EDT as the map and buildings collection needs to be changed . Parallel to this , a simulation is run on every 500ms to compute the energy allocation to the buildings on all game planets , which needs to traverse the buildings collection for statistics gathering . If the allocation is computed , it is submitted to the EDT and each building 's energy field gets assigned.Only human player interactions have this property , because the results of the AI computation are applied to the structures in EDT anyway.In general , 75 % of the object attributes are static and used only for rendering . The rest of it is changeable either via user interaction or simulation/AI decision . It is also ensured , that no new simulation/AI step is started until the previous one has written back all changes.My objectives are : Avoid delaying the user interaction , e.g . user places the building onto the planet and only after 0.5s gets the visual feedbackAvoid blocking the EDT with computation , lock wait , etc.Avoid concurrency issues with collection traversal and modification , attribute changesOptions : Fine grained object lockingImmutable collectionsVolatile fieldsPartial snapshotAll of these have advantages , disadvantages and causes to the model and the game.Update 2 : I 'm talking about this game . My clone is here . The screenshots might help to imagine the rendering and data model interactions.Update 3 : I 'll try to give a small code sample for clarify my problem as it seems from the comments it is misunderstood : So the overlapping is between the onAddBuildingClicked ( ) and distributePower ( ) . Now imagine the case where you have 50 of these kind of overlappings between various parts of the game model ."
"I need some help with understanding how Websphere Liberty ( 18.0.0.1 ) handles exceptions thrown within a JAX-RS endpoint invocation .

"Consider the three following classes : EntityTransformer contains a map associating an Entity with a StringEntity is an object containing an ID ( used by equals / hashcode ) , and which contains a reference to an EntityTransformer ( note the circular dependency ) SomeWrapper contains an EntityTransformer , and maintains a Map associating Entity 's identifiers and the corresponding Entity object.The following code will create an EntityTransformer and a Wrapper , add two entities to the Wrapper , serialize it , deserialize it and test the presence of the two entitites : The output is : { a1=whatever-a1 , a2=whatever-a2 } false trueSo basically , the serialization failed somehow , as the map should contain both entities as Keys . I suspect the cyclic dependency between Entity and EntityTransformer , and indeed if I make static the EntityManager instance variable of Entity , it works . Question 1 : given that I 'm stuck with this cyclic dependency , how could I overcome this issue ? Another very weird thing : if I remove the Map maintaining an association between identifiers and Entities in the Wrapper , everything works fine ... ? ? Question 2 : someone understand what 's going on here ?

If a key contains ( directly or indirectly ) a circular reference to the map , the following order of execution is possible during deserialization -- - if the key was written to the object stream before the hashmap : Instantiate the key Deserialize the key 's attributes 2a . Deserialize the HashMap ( which was directly or indirectly pointed to by the key ) 2a-1 . Instantiate the HashMap 2a-2 . Read keys and values 2a-3 . Invoke hashCode ( ) on the keys to re-hash the map 2b . Deserialize the key 's remaining attributes Since 2a-3 is executed before 2b , hashCode ( ) may return the wrong answer , because the key 's attributes have not yet been fully deserialized.Now that does not explain fully why the issue can be fixed if the HashMap from Wrapper is removed , or move to the EntityTransformer class ."

I have an Enum like this : All of these dto classes extend the same abstract ( dto ) class : This would a example Dto implementation of TestADto : Is it possible ( im using Java 8 ) create a concrete instance of these in the enum reference classes without the need of knowing which concrete istance it is ? Lets say im at a certain point in a function and im having the Enum_A . Now i want to create a dto instance ( TestADto.class ) . What would be the best approach or pattern for this ? Imagine a enum with more than 100 entries and every entry has a different dto which extends the same abstract dto or implements a interface.How can i create these concrete object without writing a huge if else or switch statement or handle it case by case.I read something about reflection and proxies but not sure if this is the right way i am . Or is the current state im having already a kind of poor design ? Everything i want to reach is to assign the dto name to an enum for creating it later at some certain points . But without creating a huge condition if possible ... @ EditI forgot to mention that creating a instance of each dto needs to have object which is passed to the constructor . This object which is passed to the constructor also implements a interface .

"I am interested in low-latency code and that ` s why I tried to configure thread affinity . In particular , it was supposed to help to avoid context switches.I have configured thread affinity using https : //github.com/OpenHFT/Java-Thread-Affinity . I run very simple test code that just spins in a cycle checking a time condition.So , after the specified delay execution goes to `` else '' and approximately at the same time I see context switch . Is it an expected behavior ? What is the specific reason for this ? How can I avoid context switches in such cases ? Test DetailsI build shadowJar from this repo : https : //github.com/stepan2271/thread-affinity-example . Then I run it using the following command ( one can play around with numbers here , it doesn ` t have significant effect on test when delay > 60 ) : I also have the following test script to monitor context switches ( should be run with ID of the Java thread that is bound to core ) Typical output of this script is the following : So , after some changes in start time these numbers become stable and then I see from 1 to 3 switches exactly ( difference is less than 1 sec ) at the time when code reaches `` else '' branch.DeviationsBase configuration reproduces this behavior almost each time , while some deviations lead to situation when I didn ` t manage to reproduce .

I suspect that I 'm calling ActionEvent and actionPerformed on the wrong objects ( ActionManager has possibly nothing to do with this problem at all ) .P.S.I know that there 's a hotkey that does this ( Ctrl + = ) , but this is not what I 'm looking for ( unless there 's a command to simulate a hotkey press : ) ) ."

"I have a command line Java application which reads and writes files on Windows 7 x64 platform . Currently application runs with shipped IBM Java SE 6 . Structure as follows : Now , I replaced the jre folder with unzipped JRE 8 package . And the application started complaining that it can not `` access '' ( actually it 's write operation ) files in some_folder . If I create manually new some_folder_1 under APP_ROOT and re-configure application to use it - application runs just fine . If I delete newly created some_folder_1 and rename some_folder to some_folder_1 - application complaining that it ca n't access it ( even in read mode ) . If I replace jre folder with JRE 6 files - application start working fine.Tried comparing effective permissions via Properties - all looks the same , nothing suspicious . UAC is turned on , I 'm working and doing folders replacement under regular user.UPDATE : After I turned off UAC in Windows 7 and rebooted , application started working fine with JRE 8 . But I need to make it working with UAC turned on . When reverted UAC to on and rebooted - application with JRE 8 failed again . Also , noticed that seems JRE 8 does not create properly files in `` C : \Users\username\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files ( x86 ) \ '' , where it normally create when program attempts to write inside Program Files.UPDATE 2 : Did more troubleshooting , and narrowed problem : Application with JRE 8 fails only when it writes to `` C : \Program Files\APP_ROOT\some_folder '' By Windows 7 design in this case file expected to be created in C : \User..\VirtualStore , but JRE 8 can not do this ( which is wrong and the root of the problem ) JRE 6 can create files fine in VirtualStore.VirtualStore content was cleaned up before re-run with JRE 8The succeeded run with `` some_folder_1 '' and JRE 8 combination was because JRE 8 actually wrote inside C : \Program Files/APP_ROOT/some_folder_1 - which is violation IMHO . So , this is another problem - why JRE 8 did not redirect writing to filesystem in the VirtualStore , and modified instead C : \Program Files subfolder.If I define % localusrdir % to some C : \temp directory , JRE 8 shows the same problem , so it 's not only specific problem of VirtualStore folder , IMHO.So , I make conclusion - for some reason JRE 8 can not redirect writing output to C : \Program Files ... into C : \Users ... \VirtualStoreHow it can be fixed , so JRE 8 start writing in VirtualStore fine as JRE 6 does ?

"This question relates to Java collections - specifically Hashtable and Vector - but may also apply elsewhere.I 've read in many places how good it is to program to interfaces and I agree 100 % . The ability to program to a List interface , for instance , without regard for the underlying implementation is most certainly helpful for decoupling and testing purposes . With collections , I can see how an ArrayList and a LinkedList are applicable under different circumestances , given the differences with respect to internal storage structure , random access times , etc . Yet , these two implementations can be used under the same interface ... which is great.What I ca n't seem to place is how certain synchronized implementations ( in particular Hashtable and Vector ) fit in with these interfaces . To me , they do n't seem to fit the model . Most of the underlying data structure implementations seem to vary in how the data is stored ( LinkedList , Array , sorted tree , etc . ) , whereas synchronization deals with conditions ( locking conditions ) under which the data may be accessed . Let 's look at an example where a method returns a Map collection : Let 's assume that the application is not concerned at all with concurrency . In this case , we operate on whatever implementation the method returns via the interface ... Everybody is happy . The world is stable . However , what if the application now requires attention on the concurrency front ? We now can not operate without regard for the underlying implementation - Hashtable would be fine , but other implementations must be catered for . Let 's consider 3 scenarios:1 ) Enforce synchronization using synchronization blocks , etc . when adding/removing with the collection . Would n't this , however , be overkill in the event that a synchronized implementation ( Hashtable ) gets returned ? 2 ) Change the method signature to return Hashtable . This , however , tightly binds us to the Hashtable implementation , and as a result , the advantages of programming to an interface are thrown out the window.3 ) Make use of the concurrent package and change the method signature to return an implementation of the ConcurrentMap interface . To me , this seems like the way forward.Essentially , it just seems like certain synchronized implementations are a bit of a misfit within the collections framework in that , when programming to interfaces , the synchronization issue almost forces one to think about the underlying implementation.Am I completely missing the point here ? Thanks ."

"In order to focus on the problem I will simplify the case to the following - I have an activity A and a fragment F which is adding another fragment Child .

I can confirm that if i do n't set the target fragment the crash do not occur.I 'm not absolute sure but it seems that the reason for the crash is that the Child Fragment and its target fragment are in different FragmentManagers .

"While writing a crypto utility class I ran into a problem with the following method : In the particular case of javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec the above method would work just fine in java7 because SecretKeySpec ( javadocs 7 ) does not implement Destroyable ( javadocs 7 ) Now with java8 the class SecretKeySpec ( javadocs 8 ) has been made Destroyable ( javadocs 8 ) and the method Destroyable # destroy is now default which is fine according this statement Default methods enable you to add new functionality to the interfaces of your libraries and ensure binary compatibility with code written for older versions of those interfaces.then the code compiles without any problems despite the fact that the class ScretKeySpec itself has not been changed , alone the interface SecretKey has been.The problem is that in oracle 's jdk8 the destroy method has the following implementation : which leads to an exception at run time .

The test above passes with java7 but does not with java8So my questions are : How to deal in general with default methods which might lead to exceptions - because not implemented or not supported - or unexpected behavior at run time ? aside from doing which is only valid for java8 and which might not be correct in future releases , since the default method might get a meaningful implementation.Would it not be better to leave this default method empty instead of throwing an exception ( which IMO is misleading since aside from the legit call to destroy nothing has been attempted to effectively destroy the key , an UnsupportedOperationException would have been a better fit and you would know instantly what is going on ) Is my approach with ( type check/cast/call ) for determining whether to destroy or not wrong ? What would be an alternative ? Is this a misconception or did they just forget to add meaningful implementation in ScretKeySpec ?"

I 'm having an issue in Java calculating the current date minus a certain amount of days.I have : This is returning Tue Feb 16 09:04:18 EST 2016 when it should actually return Tue Dec 28 16:06:11 EST 2015 ( 25 days into the past ) .What 's very strange is that for any number under 25 days works completely fine : As in 24 days into the past returns a predictable Tue Dec 29 16:06:11 EST 2015 .

"Problem [ Here follows a description of what the app should do under which constrains ] I want a data-structure that searches if a string exists in a 250,000 word-list , while using only a fair amount of ram and keeping the time it takes to load this data-structure into ram small ( let 's say 0-8 seconds ) . The time it takes to find a word should also be quick ( let 's say 0 to 0.5 second ) , but ram usage is more important . It should also be possible to create multiple games ( more on what this game is about at the title `` use '' ) without needing significant more memory . It would also be highly valuable to know which words start with a string , but not enough so to sacrifice load-time by many seconds.UseIt is for an Android offline game . Limited ram is available . The maximum amount of ram an Application can use according to this post is between 16-32mb ram depending on the device . My empty Android Application already uses about 17mb ( using Memory Monitor in Android Studio ) . My android device caps the ram usage off at 26mb , leaving me at about 8mb of free space for my whole Activity.Options I triedThey all seem doomed in different ways.Hashmap - Read all words into a hash-map object.1.1 initialize speed : slow to read each word into the Hash-map with 23 seconds.1.2 ram usage : uses significant amount of ram , although I forgot how much exactly.1.3 search speed : Finding if a word existed in the list was quick of course.1.4 narrowing down on possible words ( optional ) : slow , needs to go through the whole hash-map and delete them one by one . Also because it 's using deletion , multiple games wo n't be able to be played using the same instance of the hash-map . Too much memory would be taken when adding more games , making narrowing down on the possible words therefor impossible . Trie - Implement a RadixTree & You can see my implementation here.2.1 initialize speed : slow to read each word into the RadixTree with 47 seconds.2.2 ram usage : uses significant amount of ram , so much that Android is suspending threads a couple of times.2.3 search speed : Finding if a word existed in the list was quick.2.4 narrowing down on possible words ( optional ) : Ultra fast since only a reference to a node in the tree is needed to then find all possible words as its children . You can play a lot of games with narrowing down the possible words since an extra game requires only a reference to a node in the tree ! Scanner - Go through the word-file sequentially3.1 initialize speed : none.3.2 ram usage : none.3.3 search speed : about 20 seconds.3.4 narrowing down on possible words ( optional ) : ca n't be done realistically.simple code : Options I thought of : Long-binary-search-tree : Converting the word-list to a list of longs then reading these in and doing a binary search on them.1.1 initialize speed : probably the same as a hash-map or little less with about 20 seconds . However I hope calling Array.sort ( ) does not take too much time , no idea as of yet.1.2 ram usage : if you only account 12 letter words or lower with a 26 letter alphabet you need 5 bits ( 2^5= 32 ) to encode a string . An array of longs would need then 250,000*8 bits = around 2mb . Which is not too much . 1.3 search speed : Arrays.binarySearch ( ) 1.4 narrowing down on possible words ( optional ) : Narrowing down on possible words could be possible but I am not sure how . According to a comment on this post.Hashmap with storage - Creating a hashfunction that maps a word to an index number of the word-list file . Then accessing the file at this specific location and look from here to find if a word exists . You can make use of the ordering of the alphabet to determine if you can still find the word since the word-list is in natural order.2.1 initialize speed : not needed ( since I need to put every word at the right index beforehand . ) 2.2 ram usage : none.2.3 search speed : fast.2.4 narrowing down on possible words ( optional ) : not possible.Specific questions I haveAre the options I have thought of in the `` Options I have thought of '' section viable options or are there things I missed yet which would make them not possible to implement ? Are there options I have not thought of which are better/equal in performance ? End remarksI have been stuck at this for about a week now . So any new ideas are more than welcome . If any of my assumption above are incorrect I would also be pleased to hear about them . I made this post this way so others could learn from them as well , either by seeing my mistakes or seeing what does work in the answers ."

"I 'm having a problem with spring data rest when I 'm handling dates . In a brief , it is delaying the date in one day . For example , if I have 1111-11-11 it returns to me 1111-11-10.There are some related post here in SO ( ex1 , ex2 , ex3 ) , but none of them solved the problem.I have an entity with this LocalDate : I also have this repository : When I save the birthDate in the database ( I 'm using MySQL ) , it saves correctly . However , when I make this query , for example : The date is fetched with one day late ( just like in the example above ) .I tried to implement this suggestion , that is , change the LocalDate to Date and include the Jackson annotation , but it does n't work . I also tried to include the jackson-modules-java8 , but the problem still.Now the most intriguing thing . As I was just testing I was including the date 1111-11-11 . I changed that for today 's date 2019-02-06 . Then , the fetch works ! At this time , I think if it was a problem with very old dates . Thus , I tried , for example , 1970-01-01 , and the spring returned 1969-12-31 . I realized that if I include in the database dates above 1986-01-01 everything works fine . However , if I include anything below that , I got the date one day late.Is someone has some hint about this issue ? Thank you for your time !

"I use spring security in my project.I have feature to change login . To achieve this aim I use following codeBut now I am resesarching this code in details and see that authentication field is not volatile thus visibility is not guaranteed : Should I wrap my code with my own synchronization to achieve visibility ? P.S.I have read https : //stackoverflow.com/a/30781541/2674303 In an application which receives concurrent requests in a single session , the same SecurityContext instance will be shared between threads . Even though a ThreadLocal is being used , it is the same instance that is retrieved from the HttpSession for each thread . This has implications if you wish to temporarily change the context under which a thread is running . If you just use SecurityContextHolder.getContext ( ) , and call setAuthentication ( anAuthentication ) on the returned context object , then the Authentication object will change in all concurrent threads which share the same SecurityContext instance . You can customize the behaviour of SecurityContextPersistenceFilter to create a completely new SecurityContext for each request , preventing changes in one thread from affecting another . Alternatively you can create a new instance just at the point where you temporarily change the context . The method SecurityContextHolder.createEmptyContext ( ) always returns a new context instance.but I do n't understand how spring does guaranties visibility . There are just written that each thread within session will see changes . but there is no answer how fast ? and more important - visibility mechanism is not explained"

"My engine is executing 1,000,000 of simulations on X deals . During each simulation , for each deal , a specific condition may be verified . In this case , I store the value ( which is a double ) into an array . Each deal will have its own list of values ( i.e . these values are indenpendant from one deal to another deal ) .At the end of all the simulations , for each deal , I run an algorithm on his List < Double > to get some outputs . Unfortunately , this algorithm requires the complete list of these values , and thus , I am not able to modify my algorithm to calculate the outputs `` on the fly '' , i.e . during the simulations.In `` normal '' conditions ( i.e . X is low , and the condition is verified less than 10 % of the time ) , the calculation ends correctly , even if this may be enhanced.My problem occurs when I have many deals ( for example X = 30 ) and almost all of my simulations verify my specific condition ( let say 90 % of simulations ) . So just to store the values , I need about 900,000 * 30 * 64bits of memory ( about 216Mb ) . One of my future requirements is to be able to run 5,000,000 of simulations ... So I ca n't continue with my current way of storing the values . For the moment , I used a `` simple '' structure of Map < String , List < Double > > , where the key is the ID of the element , and List < Double > the list of values.So my question is how can I enhance this specific part of my application in order to reduce the memory usage during the simulations ? Also another important note is that for the final calculation , my List < Double > ( or whatever structure I will be using ) must be ordered . So if the solution to my previous question also provide a structure that order the new inserted element ( such as a SortedMap ) , it will be really great ! I am using Java 1.6.Edit 1My engine is executing some financial calculations indeed , and in my case , all deals are related . This means that I can not run my calculations on the first deal , get the output , clean the List < Double > , and then move to the second deal , and so on.Of course , as a temporary solution , we will increase the memory allocated to the engine , but it 's not the solution I am expecting ; ) Edit 2Regarding the algorithm itself . I ca n't give the exact algorithm here , but here are some hints : We must work on a sorted List < Double > . I will then calculate an index ( which is calculated against a given parameter and the size of the List itself ) . Then , I finally return the index-th value of this List.I hope it will help to have such information now ... Edit 3Currently , I will not consider any hardware modification ( too long and complicated here : ( ) . The solution of increasing the memory will be done , but it 's just a quick fix.I was thinking of a solution that use a temporary file : Until a certain threshold ( for example 100,000 ) , my List < Double > stores new values in memory . When the size of List < Double > reaches this threshold , I append this list in the temporary file ( one file per deal ) .Something like that : At the end of the whole calculation , for each deal , I will reconstruct the complete List < Double > from what I have in memory and also in the temporary file . Then , I run my algorithm . I clean the values for this deal , and move to the second deal ( I can do that now , as all the simulations are now finished ) .What do you think of such solution ? Do you think it is acceptable ? Of course I will lose some time to read and write my values in an external file , but I think this can be acceptable , no ?"
"Consider this code ( complete class , runs fine , all classes in one class for the sake of brevity ) .My questions are after the code listing : Questions : From the compilers point of view , what is the origin of the switchon method in Smartphone ? Is it inherited from the base class Gadget ? Or is it an implementation of the switchon method mandated by the switchonable interface ? Does the annotation make any difference here ? In the main method , first loop : Here , we see a case of runtime polymorphism - i.e. , when the first for loop is running , and gadget.switchon ( ) is called , it first prints `` Gadget is switching on '' , and then it prints `` Smartphone is switching on '' .

"ArrayList # get , set and remove call the rangeCheck method at first . This method does not check if the index is negative . It only checks if the index is greater than or equal to the length of the array . Javadoc explains the reason ; an array access throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if index is negative.According to Java Langauage Specification , an array access throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if index is not only negative but also gte . All array accesses are checked at run time ; an attempt to use an index that is less than zero or greater than or equal to the length of the array causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown.I think that rangeCheck should check both negative and gte or , for performance , should check neither.Why does not rangeCheck check if the index is negative ?"

"Before talking about FileInputStream , I am starting with a scenario where there are two perfectly valid , overloaded methods but where the compiler will get confused and then report a compile-time error in response to certain inputs . Here are the methods . Here is the complete code showing the use of the methods : Because an int literal value can be passed to a variable of type double , both methods are acceptable candidates for literal values 2 and 3 , and therefore the compiler fails to decide which method to pick . This is where I get confused when I take the above concept with me , dive further into the Java 7 API to the FileInputStream class , and study about two overloaded constructors of that class . public FileInputStream ( String name ) throws FileNotFoundException { ... .. } public FileInputStream ( File file ) throws FileNotFoundException { ... .. } According to the Java 7 API source code , the definition of the version that takes a String object as the argument is : Now , if `` name '' is indeed null , this ( name ! = null ? new File ( name ) : null ) ; evaluates to this ( null ) ; which in turn is equivalent to invocation of FileInputStream ( null ) ; but then both FileInputStream ( String ) and FileInputStream ( File ) become possible choices to be invoked with a null value . Does it not give rise to ambiguity ? So , is n't there a compile-time error for that ? I do understand that eventually a FileNotFoundException is raised , but it is a separate issue which comes later . How is the ambiguity resolved before that ?"

"BackgroundI was trying to use Annotation Processors , to generate implementations of specific Factory interfaces . Those interfaces look the following : andThe Annotation Processor is doing the correct thing and generates a factory for each matching class , that is annotated with an corresponding annotation.The ProblemThe output of the Annotation Processor is the following : and the corresponding other class : The TestViewImplFactory however can not be compiled . The error message is : `` Class 'TestViewImplFactory ' must be declared abstract or implement abstract method create ( S ) in 'ViewFactory ' '' Java says , the following is correct : which would not work at all , considering that the user wants to know , which View will be returned and which Presenter is required . I would have expected that : either both of the autogenerated files are wrong or both are correctbecause they both are really similar . I expected the first to be true.What am I missing here ? If I add the Generic type to the TestViewImplFactory like this : The problem arises , that the constructor Parameter ( which is of the Type TestPresenter ) is incorrect . Changing the S to a concrete TestPresenter will , again , make the class not compilable for the same reason as above.So , I stumbled across an `` solution '' that can be compiled.What basically has to be done , is to change the ViewFactory interface to the following : So the class definition has the same Generic type , as the method in the Question above.After compilation ( this time with generic type specification ) , the output looks like this : This can be compiled and runs successfully.This however does not answer the original question . Why is the generic explicitly stated in the type definition correct , but inherited and specified in the method declaration wrong and not compilable ?

`` Java Concurrency in Practice '' gives the following example of an unsafe class which due the nature of the java memory model may end up running forever or print 0 . The issue this class is trying to demonstrate is that the variables here are not `` shared '' between threads . So the value on thread sees can be different from another thread as they are not volatile or synchronized . Also due to the reordering of statements allowed by the JVM ready=true maybe set before number=42.For me this class always works fine using JVM 1.6 . Any idea on how to get this class to perform the incorrect behavior ( i.e . print 0 or run forever ) ?

Using this driver everything works but I do n't want to use a driver that old.UPDATE : I removed the DataStax driver dependency and tried to use the 1.5.0.M1 version of Spring Data Cassandra and overrode the Spring , Spring Data Cassandra and Cassandra driver versions in the buildscript.This resulted in the following error : when using Cassandra functionality . When I include Netty again , Cassandra functionality works but my tests using TestRestTemplate.put and .post are n't running anymore.I gave it another try upgrading to Spring Boot Version 2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT which also includes Spring Data Cassandra 1.5.0.M1 . Now when I start the app and use DataStax Driver functionality I get the same NoClassDefFoundError as before . Adding Netty as a dependency kills my TestRestTemplate based unit tests again ...

"I 'd like to listen on a websocket using akka streams . That is , I 'd like to treat it as nothing but a Source.However , all official examples treat the websocket connection as a Flow.My current approach is using the websocketClientFlow in combination with a Source.maybe . This eventually results in the upstream failing due to a TcpIdleTimeoutException , when there are no new Messages being sent down the stream.Therefore , my question is twofold : Is there a way – which I obviously missed – to treat a websocket as just a Source ? If using the Flow is the only option , how does one handle the TcpIdleTimeoutException properly ? The exception can not be handled by providing a stream supervision strategy . Restarting the source by using a RestartSource does n't help either , because the source is not the problem.UpdateSo I tried two different approaches , setting the idle timeout to 1 second for convenienceapplication.confUsing keepAlive ( as suggested by Stefano ) When doing this , the Upstream still fails with a TcpIdleTimeoutException.Using RestartFlowHowever , I found out about this approach , using a RestartFlow : This works in that I can treat the websocket as a Source ( although artifically , as explained by Stefano ) and keep the tcp connection alive by restarting the websocketClientFlow whenever an Exception occurs.This does n't feel like the optimal solution though ."

The underlying member ( mObj ) is of String type . In the first invocation , the Generic parameter is of compatible type , so the app prints the string appropriately . In the second invocation , the Generic parameter is of type Integer . Thus , the cast in the get method should fail .

So now knowing some previous prime prev I can generate the next prime iterating the numbers until I find the one matching this predicate : Putting everything together I wrote the following primes ( ) method : Now to launch this I use : Unfortunately it fails with unpleasant StackOverflowError which looks like this : You might think that I deserve what I get : I called the primes ( ) recursively inside the primes ( ) method itself .

I am developing application that uses Cassandra NoSQL database and I am adding web interface . I have 2 projects : cassandra-access ( this project is DAL ) and web ( this project is web application ) .Scenario is simple enaugh . Cassandra-access has dependencies on hector.jar which is not in maven repository . So I added this dependency to my local repository via mvn install : install-file and I list my repository in parent pom : In Web projects pom I added dependency on Cassandra-access . But when i start the Web application with hello world read from database I am getting classNotFound exception as if the hector.jar is n't on class path . When I write mvn clean install the resulting war of web project does n't include hector.jar in WEB-INF/lib . That further confirms my theory . How to achieve that war get 's all the transitive dependcies ? I thought that all dependencies that are in scope compile ( which is default ) will get copied.Web projects pom : Cassandra-access pom :

"I have a main class -- Simulator -- that uses two other classes -- Producer and Evaluator . Producer produces results , while the Evaluator evaluates those results . The Simulator controls the flow of execution by querying the Producer and then conveying the results to the Evaluator.The actual implementation of the Producer and Evaluator are known at run-time , at compile time I only know their interfaces . Below I paste the contents of interfaces , example implementations and the Simulator class.Old codeThis code should compile and run . You should get the same result ( 0.82 ) regardless which producer implementation you select.Compiler warns me about not using generics in several places : In Simulator class , in interfaces IEvaluator and IProducer , and in classes that implement the IProducer interface , I get the following warning , whenever I reference the Comparable interface : Comparable is a raw type . References to generic type Comparable should be parameterizedIn classes that implement IEvaluator I get the following warning ( when calling compareTo ( ) on the values of Map ) : Type safety : The method compareTo ( Object ) belongs to the raw type Comparable . References to generic type Comparable should be parameterizedAll that said , the Simulator works . Now , I 'd like to get rid of compile warnings . The problem is , that I have no idea , how to parametrize the interfaces IEvaluator and IProducer , and how to change the implementations of IProducer and IEvaluator . I have some limitations : I can not know the type of values in the Map that the producer will return . But I know , that they will all be of the same type and that they will implement the Comparable interface . Similarly , the IEvaluator instance does not need to know anything about results that is evaluating , except that they are of the same type and that they are comparable ( IEvaluator implemetations need to be able to call the compareTo ( ) method. ) . I have to to keep the Simulator class out of this `` Comparable '' dilemma -- it does not need to know anything about those types ( besides being of the same type , which is also comparable ) . Its job is to simply convey results from Producer to Evaluator.Any ideas ? Edited and revised versionUsing some ideas from answers below , I got to this stage , which compiles and runs without warnings and with no need to use SuppressWarnings directive . This is very similar to what Eero suggested , but the main method is a bit different.The key difference seems to be in the main method , which currently looks like this.This works . However , If I change the code to this : The darn thing wo n't even compile , saying : Bound mismatch : The generic method evaluate ( Map , Map ) of type IEvaluator is not applicable for the arguments ( Map > , Map ) . The inferred type capture # 3-of ? extends Comparable is not a valid substitute for the bounded parameter > This is totally weird to me . The code works if I invoke the evaluator.evaluate ( producer.getResults ( ) , groundTruth ) . However , if I first call producer.getResults ( ) method , and store it to a variable , and then invoke the evaluate method with that variable ( evaluator.evaluate ( ranks , groundTruth ) ) , I get the compile error ( regardless of that variable 's type ) ."

"The Java 8 coding style preferred by my colleagues is chaining asynchronous calls all the way through , e.g.I have something like the above , but with an added challenge : I need to recall values retrieved within some of the lambdas , in later lambdas . For example , When I declare Foo foo ; and Bar bar ; in the outside scope , I get errors about them not being final or effectively final . And I read about using a wrapper to make them effectively final , but it seems rather hacky to me to do this ( I do n't understand why that 's allowed ... ) I read that Java 8 did n't add support for tuples ( though it considered BiVal , which maybe I could have used to pass to BiFunction lambdas ) .

"I 'm building a management application to help manage my mobile auto detailing company ( and hopefully others ) . I 'm struggling to figure out how to model some of the data.This question is related to a previous question that I 've posted , but I 've reproduced the relevant information below : Database design - google app engineIn this application , there are concepts of `` Appointments '' and `` Line Items . `` Appointments are a place and time where employees are expected to be in order to deliver a service.Line Items are a service , fee or discount and its associated information . An example of line items that might go into an appointment : In my previous implementation of this application , Line Items were contained by a single appointment . This worked fine most of the time , but caused problems sometimes . An example would be if an appointment got interrupted half-way through because of rain and the technician had to come back out the next day and finish up . This situation required two appointments for the same line item . In cases like this , I would just fudge the data a little by setting the `` line item '' on the second appointment to read something like `` Finish Up '' and then the cost would be $ 0.In this next version , I am considering enabling Line Items to be matched with more than one appointment with a table structure that looks like this : A general problem with this structure is that it is complicated and I 'm not even sure if its appropriate to match one line item with multiple appointments . If Line Items can only be part of one Appointment , then I can actually just put a list of line items IN each Appointment , when I get Appointments , I 'd already be getting Line Items.A more specific problem is that I am using google app engine and if I want to query for a set of appointments and their associated line items , I 'd have to first query for the set of appointments and then do a second query for the line items using the IN operator to test if any of the Line_Item 's appointment keys fall into the set of appointment keys the were returned from the previous query . The second query will fail if I have more than 30 keys requiring me to shard the query . I could denormalize the data to avoid this complicated and extensive read query , and I will probably have to denormalize to some degree anyway , but I 'd rather avoid complexity where appropriate.My question is how is this type of situation usually modeled ? Is it even appropriate for a Line Item to be paired with more than one appointment , or is it normal to simply split line items into separate ones for each appointment such as `` 1st half of 2 day job '' and `` 2nd half of two day job . '' How do similar successful applications do this ? What are the rules of thumb in this type of situation ? What implementations have turned out to be less problematic ? Thanks !"

"I have always felt that in general the main work of a class should be done in its instance methods , while the constructor should only get the instance into a usable inital state.But I find that in practice there are situations where it seems to make more sense to put essentially all the actual work into the constructor.One example : I need to retrieve some DBMS-specific information from the database . The most natural way to me seemed to have a class DBMSSpecInfo , with a constructor : You would construct the class once , the constructor would fetch all data , then you could use various getters to retrieve the info you need.Of course I could put the method somewhere else , and only use DBMSSpecInfo for the return value ( essentially using DBMSSpecInfo only as a value holder ) , but it feels ugly to create a class just for returning values from a single function.So what do you think ? Are there problems with performing the main work in the constructor ? Is it `` un-idiomatic '' in Java ? Or is it an acceptable ( though possibly uncommon ) practice ?"

"Please view the edits belowI 'm trying to create a JShell instance that gives me access to , and lets me interact with objects in the JVM it was created in . This works fine with classes that have been available at compile time but fails for classes that are loaded dynamically . Additionally , exchanging DirectExecutionControl with LocalExecutionControl gives the same results , but I do not understand the difference between the two classes.How would I make classes that are loaded at runtime available to this JShell instance ? Edit : The first part of this question has been solved , below is the updated source code to demonstrate the second part of the issueThis is the expected output , if the JVM and the JShell instance do not share any memory , however adding com.example.test.C directly to the project instead of loading it dynamically changes the results as follows : Why is the memory between the JVM and the JShell instance not shared for classes loaded at runtime ?

"IntroductionI 'm working on a project where a user is able to enter facts and rules in a special format but I 'm having some trouble with checking if that format is correct and obtaining the information.When the program is launched the user can enter `` commands '' into a textarea and this text is send to a parseCommand method which determine what to do based on what the user has written . For example to add a fact or a rule you can use the prefix + . or use - to remove a fact or rule and so on . I 've created the system which handles the prefix but i 'm having trouble with the facts and rules format.Facts and rulesFacts : These are defined by an alphanumeric name and contain a list of properties ( each is withing < > signs ) and a truth value . Properties are also defined by an alphanumeric name and contain 2 strings ( called arguments ) , again each is withing < > signs . Properties can also be negative by placing an ! before it in the list . For example the user could type the following to add these 3 facts to the program : The class I use to store facts is like this : Rules : These are links between 2 properties and they are identified by the = > sign Again their name is alphanumeric . The properties are limited though as they can only have arguments made up of uppercase letters and the arguments of the second property have to be the same as those the first one . Rules also have 2 other arguments which are either set or not set by entering the name or not ( each of these arguments correspond with a property for the rule which can be Negative or Reversive ) . for example : Rule PropertiesA normal rule tells us that if , in the example below , X is a parent of Y this implies that Y is a child of X : While a Negative rule tells us that if , in the example below , X is a parent of Y this implies that Y is not a child of X : A Reversive rule however tells us that if , in the example below , Y is a child of X this implies that X is a parent of Y The last case is when the rule is both Negative and Reversive . This tells us that if , in the example below , Y is not a child of X this implies that X is a parent of Y.This is the class I use to store rules : Property class : The above examples are all valid inputs . Just to clarify here are some invalid input examples : Facts : No true or false is provided for the argument : No property given : An invalid property is provided : Note the missing bracket in the last one.Rules : One or more properties are invalid : The problemI 'm able to get the input from the user and I 'm also able to see which kind of action the user wants to preform based on the prefix.However I 'm not able to figure out how to process strings like : This is due to a number of reasons : The number of properties for a fact entered by the user is variable so I cant just split the input string based on the ( ) and < > signs.For rules , sometimes , the last 2 properties are variable so it can happen that the 'Reversive ' property is on the place in the string where you would normally find the Negative property.If I want to get arguments from this part of the input string : +familyTree ( < parent ( < John > , < Jake > ) > , to setup the property for this fact I can check for anything that is in between < > that might form a problem because there are 2 opening < before the first > What I 've triedMy first idea was to start at the beginning of the string ( which I did for getting the action from the prefix ) and then remove that piece of string from the main string.However I do n't know how to adapt this system to the problems above ( specially problem number 1 and 2 ) . I 've tried to use functions like : String.split ( ) and String.contains ( ) .How would I go about doing this ? How can I get arount the fact that not all strings contain the same information ? ( In a sense that some facts have more properties or some rules have more attributes than others . ) EDIT : I forgot to say that all the methods used to store the data are finished and work and they can be used by calling for example : infoHandler.addRule ( ) or infoHandler.removeFact ( ) . Inside these functions I could also validate input data if this is better . I could , for example , just obtain all data of the fact or rule from the string and validate things like are the arguments of the properties of rules only using uppercase letters and so on.EDIT 2 : In the comments someone has suggested using a parser generator like ANTLR or JavaCC . I ' e looked into that option in the last 3 days but I ca n't seem to find any good source on how to define a custom language in it . Most documentation assumes you 're trying to compile an exciting language and recommend downloading the language file from somewhere instead of writing your own .

"Yesterday I read about the comma operator in Java for for-loops . Which worked as I expected them to . I thought of this construction but it does not work as expected .

"I have a Java client which wants to communicate with a device through messages over serial communication . The client should be able to use a clean API , abstracting the ugly details of the serial communication . The client can send many types of messages through that API and gets responses . I 'm searching for advice which way is best to implement this API . For simplicity , say we have only two message types : HelloMessage which triggers a HelloResponse and InitMessage which triggers an InitResponse ( in reality , there are many more ) Designing the API ( that is , the Java abstraction of the device ) I could have : One method per message type : This is nicely type safe . ( It could also be many times the same send ( ) method , overloaded , but that 's about the same ) . But it is very explicit , and not very flexible - we can not add messages without modification of the API.I could also have a single send method , which takes all message types : This simplifies the API ( only one method ) and allows for additional Message types to be added later without changing the API . At the same time , it requires the Client to check the Response type and cast it to the right type.Client code : This is ugly in my opinion.What do you recommend ? Are there other approaches which give cleaner results ? References welcome ! How did others solve this ?"

The point of the code was n't to show off anything particular exciting , but mostly to make sure students understood variable assignment statements.I had the following method up on the board and was tracing through it one line at a time : A student asked me whether myInt would ever actually hold the values 137 and 42 when the program ran , or if it would just jump straight to holding 43 . I told the student that the code would execute each line in turn , so the variable would actually hold these intermediate values.Honestly , though , I was n't sure what bytecode javac would emit ( completely ignoring the optimizations done by the JVM ) .

When I to try get it again I receive exception for custom UserDetails implementation : User enity : I noticed that when I change in returned value in UserDetailsServiceImpl to User from org.springframework.security.core.userdetails package it works fine.The problem occurs in JdbcTokenStore getAccessToken methodI do not really understand why this problem occurs for custom User and works fine for User from spring security package . Did anyone have similar problem before ? Of course at the end using sprign user is some kind of workaround but I would like to understand why it does not work this way.EDIT : Stacktrace

"First I 'll summarize what I 've found so far.This answer suggests that changing the concurrencyLevel parameter of ConcurrentHashMap 's constructor might help . I 've tried that and my code still hanged.Answers here suggest that it could be a runtime bug.What I 'm trying to do : I have 10 worker threads running along with a main thread . The worker threads will have to process many arrays to find the index of the max element in the array ( if there are multiple max values , the first occurrence will be used ) . Among these `` many arrays , '' some of them can be duplicate , so I 'm trying to avoid those full array scans to speed up the program.The controller class contains a ConcurrentHashMap that maps the hash values of arrays to the corresponding max-element indices.The worker threads will ask the controller class for the mapped index first before trying to calculate the index by doing full array scans . In the latter case , the newly calculated index will be put into the map.The main thread does not access the hash map.What happened : My code will hang after 70,000 ~ 130,000 calls to getMaxIndex ( ) . This count is obtained by putting a log string into getMaxIndex ( ) so it might not be exactly accurate.My CPU usage will gradually go up for ~6 seconds , and then it will go down to ~10 % after peaked at ~100 % . I have plenty of unused memory left . ( Does this look like deadlock ? ) If the code does not use map it works just fine ( see getMaxIndex ( ) version 2 below ) .I 've tried to add synchronized to getMaxIndex ( ) 's signature and use the regular HashMap instead , that also did not work.I 've tried to use different initialCapacity values too ( e.g . 50,000 & 100,000 ) . Did not work.Here 's my code : The worker thread will call getMaxIndex ( ) like this : return remaining [ controller.getMaxIndex ( arr ) ] ; , remaining is just another int array.getMaxIndex ( ) v2 : JVM info in case it matters : EDIT : stack dump ; I used Phaser to synchronize the worker threads , so some of them appear to be waiting on the phaser , but pool-1-thread-2 , pool-1-thread-10 , pool-1-thread-11 , and pool-1-thread-12 do not appear to be waiting on the phaser ."

I have a small webView in one of my layouts that act as a news feed from my website.Every time I changed rotation it would reload the web page . so I edited the code to include a on config change and on restore state.Then adjusted my android manifest to include the config changes which from the dev site says to include orientation and screen size.This solves the problem of saving the state but in turn creates a new problem which is I have different size layouts for when its in landscape mode on certain devices . but with the manifest set how it is it overrides screen size . is there away to save the state but with out using screen size in my manifest . so then i could use my landscape layout here is my code for the orientation changes.then my manifest file has ive added a container an a web view fragment but now the view disappears when rotation is landscape . then disappears completly when i switch back . so i tried adding the save out state and savestate to it which loaded the webview when rotated to landscape but crashed the app when going back to portrait

"I know that static methods ca n't be abstracted nor can they be overridden , only hidden ( and in which case late bindings do n't happen ) . With regard to this , I am struggling with a logical way to express the following relationship : In this contrived example , max power is an attribute that I expect every spell to know ( and every subclass of Spell has an individual max power that applies to all instances of itself ) . In other SO threads , the proposed solution to this impossible situation is to make getMaxPower ( ) an instance method . However , I do n't think this makes sense because power is an implementation detail that is useful to know before instantiation ( eg . Constructing an array of spell instances from power 1 to the max power of that spell ) .A solution that I see is creating a factory for each spell ( or a more generic one for all spells ) , which has an instance method getMaxPower ( ) that knows the max power attribute of the spell which it instantiates . However , this also does n't seem optimal to me because : It makes more sense for each spell to know its own propertiesThis makes the subclass of Spell oblivious to an implementation detail ( namely , its constructor ca n't check whether a provided power exceeds its max power ) Is the factory pattern the correct approach ? If so , what would be the logical justification to it ? If not , is there a pattern that more appropriately fits this problem ?"

I should mention that I 've also increased the JVM 's heap size to 7GB ( max and start ) , without that I rather quickly get an out of memory error.I do n't mind waiting for several hours/days but it looks like the thing grinds to a halt after about 10 hours.I guess my question is , how can I go about analysing this data ? Are the things I 've tried the right things ? Are there things I 'm missing ? The Java solution seems to be the best so far , is there anything I can do to get it work ?"

"We have a Java web app with a hibernate backend that provides REST resources . Now we 're facing the task to implement a generic search that is controlled by the query parameters in our get request : or similar . We do n't want to predefine all possible parameters ( name , created_on , something ) We do n't want to have to analyze the request String to pick up control characters ( like > = ) nor do we do n't want to implement our own grammar to reflect things like _eq _like _goe and so on ( as an alternative or addition to control characters ) Is there some kind of framework that provides help with this mapping from GET request parameters to database query ? Since we know which REST resource we 're GETing we have the entity / table ( select ) . It probably will also be necessary to predefine the JOINs that will be executed in order to limit the depths of a search . But other than that we want the REST consuming client to be able to execute any search without us having to predefine how a certain parameter and a certain control sequence will get translated into a search.Right now I 'm trying some semi automatic solution building on Mysemas QueryDSL . It allows me to predefine the where columns and sort columns and I 'm working on a simple string comparison to detect things like '_like ' , '_loe ' , ... in a parameter and then activate the corresponding predefined part of the search . Not much different from an SQL String except that it 's SQL injection proof an type save . However I still have to tell my search object that it should be able to potentially handle a query `` look for a person with name like ' ? ? ? ' '' . Right now this is okay as we only consume the REST resource internally and isolate the actual search creation quite well . If we need to make a search do more we can just add more predefinitions for now . But should we make our REST resources public at some time in the future that wo n't be so great.So we 're wondering , there has to be some framework or best practice or recommended solution to approaching this . We 're not the first who want this . Redmine for example offers all of its resource via a REST interface and I can query at will . Or facebook with its Graph API . I 'm sure those guys did n't just predefine all possibilities but rather created some generic grammar . We 'd like to save as much as possible on that effort and use available solutions instead.Like I said , we 're using Hibernate so an SQL or HQL solution would be fine or anything that builds on entities like QueryDsl . ( Also there 's the security issue concerning SQL injection ) Any suggestions ? Ideas ? Will we just have to do it all ourselves ?"
"I have a question . Where did these methods go ? I 've tried to browse git history for Dialect.java , but no luck . I found that something likeMultiTableBulkIdStrategy was created but I could n't find any example of how to use it.To the point ... I have legacy code ( using hibernate 4.3.11 ) which is doing batch delete frommultiple tables using temporary table . In those tables there may be 1000 rows , but also there maybe 10 milion rows . So just to make sure I do n't kill DB with some crazy delete I create temp table where I put ( using select query with some condition ) 1000 ids at onceand then use this temp table to delete data from 4 tables . It 's running in while cycle until all data based on some condition is not deleted.Transaction is commited after each cycle.To make it more complicated this code has to run on top of : mysql , mariadb , oracle , postgresql , sqlserver and h2.It was done using native SQL , with methods mentioned above . But not I ca n't find a way howto refactor it.My first try was to create query using nested select like this : delete from TABLE where id in ( select id from TABLE where CONDITION limit 1000 ) but this is way slower as I have to run select query multiple times for each delete and limit is not supported in nested select in HQL.Any ideas or pointers ?

"I 'm trying to learn how the serialization works with Java and its lastest version . I 'm trying to serialize a lambda like this : But I notice that I have no warning about the absence of a serialVersionUID variable . Is it normal ? I know it will be generated at the runtime however it is strongly recommended to define it : https : //docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html If a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialVersionUID , then the serialization runtime will calculate a default serialVersionUID value for that class based on various aspects of the class , as described in the Java ( TM ) Object Serialization Specification . However , it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialVersionUID values , since the default serialVersionUID computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations , and can thus result in unexpected InvalidClassExceptions during deserialization . Therefore , to guarantee a consistent serialVersionUID value across different java compiler implementations , a serializable class must declare an explicit serialVersionUID value . It is also strongly advised that explicit serialVersionUID declarations use the private modifier where possible , since such declarations apply only to the immediately declaring class -- serialVersionUID fields are not useful as inherited members . Array classes can not declare an explicit serialVersionUID , so they always have the default computed value , but the requirement for matching serialVersionUID values is waived for array classes.What should I do ? How can I define it in my Lambda ? Thanks"

"I have been working on the Interview Street challenge Changing Bits in my spare time for a little over a week now and just spinning my wheels at this point so I am hoping someone might be able to give me a pointer or hint in the right direction . The basics of the challenge is taking two bit strings A & B and running a number of queries manipulating the two bit strings.Let A and B be two N bit numbers . You are given initial values for A and B , and you should write a program which processes three kinds of queries : set_a idx x : Set A [ idx ] to x , where 0 < = idx < N , where A [ idx ] isidx'th least significant bit of A.set_b idx x : Set B [ idx ] to x , where 0 < = idx < N.get_c idx : Print C [ idx ] , where C=A+B , and 0 < =idxWhere the bit numbers are length 1 to 100,000 and the program can have between 1 to 500,000 queries of any combination of set_a , set_b , or get_c . To minimize looping I am using C as a running total . When a bit in A or B changes , the changed bit is also added or subtracted , from C. Further minimizing looping when adding and subtracting is done from the changed bit to left hand while there is still a carry bit . Overall the program runs pretty well completing the worst edge case of bit length of 100,000 and 500,000 queries runs in about 120ms but it is still not fast enough for the purposes of the challenge . Due to the size of the bit length quickly exceeds the primitive integer ( long as well ) values in Java so most of the API is not applicable for this . As I am not making much progress increasing the overall run time magnitude is starting to suggest there might be an algorithm or data structure that is better suited for this than just an array . Any thoughts ?"
"So I 'm trying to explore Clojure 's internals and I 've come across something I 'm not quite sure I understand : From the REPL , I can access RT.var ( `` clojure.core '' , '' require '' ) just fine ( this is supposed to return the var associated with the `` require '' symbol in the `` clojure.core '' namespace ) : However , if I try to access it in what I thought was the same way ( I get an error that require already refers to something that exists .

"How can I optimize the next ( ) and hasNext ( ) methods in the following generator which produces combinations of a bounded multiset ? ( I posted this to C++ as well as Java because the code is C++-compatible and has no Java-specific elements that do not convert directly to C++.The specific areas of the algorithm which are problematic are the entire hasNext ( ) method which may be unnecessarily complicated , and the line : if ( current [ xSlot ] > 0 ) aiItemsUsed [ current [ xSlot ] ] -- ; which has an if-statement I think could be removed somehow . I had an earlier version of the algorithm which had some of the backtracking before the return statement and consequently had a much simpler hasNext ( ) test , but I could not get that version to work.The background of this algorithm is that it is very difficult to find . For example , in Knuth 7.2.1.3 he merely says that it can be done ( and gives an exercise to prove that the algorithm is possible ) , but does not give an algorithm . Likewise , I have half a dozen advanced texts on combinatorics ( including Papadimitriou and Kreher/Stimson ) and none of them give an algorithm for generating combinations of a multiset . Kreher leaves it as an `` exercise for the reader '' . Anyway , if you can improve the algorithm as above or provide a reference to a working implementation more efficient than mine I would appreciate it . Please give only iterative algorithms ( no recursion , please ) .ADDITIONAL INFOSome of the respondents so far seem to not understand the difference between a set and a bounded multiset . A bounded multiset has repeating elements . For example { a , a , b , b , b , c } is a bounded multiset , which would be encoded as { 3 , 2 , 3 , 1 } in my algorithm . Note that the leading `` 3 '' is the number of item types ( unique items ) in the set . If you supply an algorithm , then the following test should produce the output as shown below ."

"When logging stack traces for unhandled exceptions in Java or Android ( e.g . via ACRA ) , you usually get the stack trace as a plain long string.Now all services that offer crash reporting and analysis ( e.g . Google Play Developer Console , Crashlytics ) group those stack traces into unique buckets . This is obviously helpful -- otherwise , you could have tens of thousands of crash reports in your list , but only a dozen of them may be unique.Example : The stack trace above may appear in multiple variants , e.g . the platform classes like AsyncTask may appear with varying line numbers due to different platform versions.What 's the best technique to get a unique identifier for every crash report ? What 's clear is that with every new application version that you publish , crash reports should be handled separatedly , because the compiled source is different . In ACRA , you can consider using the field APP_VERSION_CODE.But otherwise , how do you identify reports with unique causes ?

I 'm trying to use orientdb ( v2.1.2 ) in an multithreaded environment ( Java 8 ) where i update a vertex from within multiple threads . I 'm aware that orientdb is using MVCC and thus those operations may fail and have to be executed again.I wrote a small unit test that tries to provoke such situations by waiting on a cyclic barrier within the threads i fork . Unfortunately the test fails with an obscure Exception which i do n't understand : The test is using a simple in-memory database . I do n't get why orientdb is checking some cluster actions : Cluster with id 11 already belongs to class testedgeSomehow this issue only appears when i try to create two edges with the same label.In general i would be very thankful for a example that demonstrates how to deal with MVCC conflicts when using orientdb in an embedded multithreaded java environment.Update : I noticed that the problem no longer occures when i reload the vertex within my thread via tx.getVertex ( vertex.getId ( ) ) ( not via .reload ( ) ) . I get various errors when i just pass the vertex object reference to my thread and use it there . I assume the OrientVertex class is not threadsafe .

"Suppose I have an interface that supports a few potential operations : Now , some instances will only support one or the other of these operations . They may support both . The client code wo n't necessarily know until it actually gets one from the relevant factory , via dependency injection , or wherever it is getting instances from.I see a few ways of handling this . One , which seems to be the general tactic taken in the Java API , is to just have the interface as shown above and have unsupported methods raise UnsupportedOperationException . This has the disadvantage , however , of not being fail-fast - client code ca n't tell whether doFoo will work until it tries to call doFoo.This could be augmented with supportsFoo ( ) and supportsBar ( ) methods , defined to return true iff the corresponding do method works.Another strategy is to factor the doFoo and doBar methods into FooFrobnicator and BarFrobnicator methods , respectively . These methods would then return null if the operation is unsupported . To keep the client code from having to do instanceof checks , I define a Frobnicator interface as follows : Alternatively , FooFrobnicator and BarFrobnicator could extend Frobnicator , and the get* methods possibly be renamed as*.One issue with this is naming : the Frobnicator really is n't a frobnicator , it 's a way of getting frobnicators ( unless I use the as* naming ) . It also gets a tad unwieldy . The naming may be further complicated , as the Frobnicator will be retrieved from a FrobnicatorEngine service.Does anyone have any insight into a good , preferably well-accepted solution to this problem ? Is there an appropriate design pattern ? Visitor is not appropriate in this case , as the client code needs a particular type of interface ( and should preferably fail-fast if it ca n't get it ) , as opposed to dispatching on what kind of object it got . Whether or not different features are supported can vary on a variety of things - the implementation of Frobnicator , the run-time configuration of that implementation ( e.g . it supports doFoo only if some system service is present to enable Foo ) , etc.Update : Run-time configuration is the other monkey wrench in this business . It may be possible to carry the FooFrobnicator and BarFrobnicator types through to avoid the problem , particularly if I make heaver use of Guice-modules-as-configuration , but it introduces complexity into other surrounding interfaces ( such as the factory/builder that produces Frobnicators in the first place ) . Basically , the implementation of the factory that produces frobnicators is configured at run-time ( either via properties or a Guice module ) , and I want it to make it fairly easy for the user to say `` hook up this frobnicator provider an this client '' . I admit that it 's a problem with potential inherent design problems , and that I may also be overthinking some of the generalization issues , but I 'm going for some combination of least-ugliness and least-astonishment ."

I have not been able to find any great examples to outline using Java 's new HTTP2 support.In previous versions of Java ( Java 8 ) I was making many calls to a REST server using multiple threads . I had a global list of parameters and I would go through the parameters to make different sorts of requests.For example : In the previous code what I would do is construct multiple HTTP requests to the same server with just a little change in the parameter . This took a while to complete so I even would break up the work using threads so that each thread would work on some chunk of the param array.With HTTP2 I would now not have to create a brand new connection every time . The problem is I do not quite understand how to implement this using the new versions of Java ( Java 9 - 11 ) .If I have an array param as I do previously how would I do the following : Essentially I am looking for an example to do what I was doing previously but now utilizing HTTP2.Regards

"QuestionSee updated question in edit section belowI 'm trying to decompress large ( ~300M ) GZIPed files from Amazon S3 on the fly using GZIPInputStream but it only outputs a portion of the file ; however , if I download to the filesystem before decompression then GZIPInputStream will decompress the entire file.How can I get GZIPInputStream to decompress the entire HTTPInputStream and not just the first part of it ? What I 've Triedsee update in the edit section belowI suspected a HTTP problem except that no exceptions are ever thrown , GZIPInputStream returns a fairly consistent chunk of the file each time and , as far as I can tell , it always breaks on a WET record boundary although the boundary it picks is different for each URL ( which is very strange as everything is being treated as a binary stream , no parsing of the WET records in the file is happening at all . ) The closest question I could find is GZIPInputStream is prematurely closed when reading from s3 The answer to that question was that some GZIP files are actually multiple appended GZIP files and GZIPInputStream does n't handle that well . However , if that is the case here why would GZIPInputStream work fine on a local copy of the file ? Demonstration Code and OutputBelow is a piece of sample code that demonstrates the problem I am seeing . I 've tested it with Java 1.8.0_72 and 1.8.0_112 on two different Linux computers on two different networks with similar results . I expect the byte count from the decompressed HTTPInputStream to be identical to the byte count from the decompressed local copy of the file , but the decompressed HTTPInputStream is much smaller.OutputSample CodeEditClosed Stream and associated Channel in demonstration code as per comment by @ VGR.UPDATE : The problem does seem to be something specific to the file . I pulled the Common Crawl WET archive down locally ( wget ) , uncompressed it ( gunzip 1.8 ) , then recompressed it ( gzip 1.8 ) and re-uploaded to S3 and the on-the-fly decompression then worked fine . You can see the test if you modify the sample code above to include the following lines : URL rezippeds3 points to the WET archive file that I downloaded , decompressed and recompressed , then re-uploaded to S3 . You will see the following output : As you can see once the file was recompressed I was able to stream it through GZIPInputStream and get the entire file . The original file still shows the usual premature end of the decompression . When I downloaded and uploaded the WET file without recompressing it I got the same incomplete streaming behavior so it was definitely the recompression that fixed it . I also put both files , the original and the recompressed , onto a traditional Apache web server and was able to replicate the results , so S3 does n't seem to have anything to do with the problem.So . I have a new question.New QuestionWhy would a FileInputStream behave differently than a HTTPInputStream when reading the same content . If it is the exact same file why does : new GZIPInputStream ( urlConnection.getInputStream ( ) ) ; behave any differently than new GZIPInputStream ( new FileInputStream ( `` ./test.wet.gz '' ) ) ; ? ? Is n't an input stream just an input stream ? ?"

"Is the Javadocs for Java 8 incomplete ? Some of the method comments are omitted and the method description is copied ( incorrectly ) from a base class ( e.g . the java.util.IntSummaryStatistics toString ( ) method with the note `` Description copied from class : Object '' . Description copied from class : Object Returns a string representation of the object . In general , the toString method returns a string that `` textually represents '' this object . The result should be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a person to read . It is recommended that all subclasses override this method . The toString method for class Object returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance , the at-sign character ' @ ' , and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object . In other words , this method returns a string equal to the value of : Overrides : toString in class Object Returns : a string representation of the object.The actual toString method returns class specific information like this : and not the default inherited from class Object , as shown here ."
"I want this library I 'm working on to have logging support , but Android and SE have their own ways of logging . In SE you can use System.out.println methods or the java.util.logging.Logger class . Android uses android.util.Log to log on logcat . At first I used reflection to check if android was usable , then reflectively call the log methods in Log.class ; but that was n't a good idea . My solution is to have the developers using my library handle logs themselves . There will be a Handler interface they set and has an onLog methodThe library will call the onLog method on the handlers in my custom Logger class . Is it a good idea to have developers handle the logs instead of the library itself ? Seems to be the best solution so far and if I document it good then it should't be an issue ."
"I wanted to try my hand at encrypting a file and utilized the following stack overflow response .

[ I assume the library is n't broke and that I 'm doing something improperly ; but it 's a scary thought that others may be in the same boat and not realize it . ] Example : Q : Why is n't the entire decryption failing ? Speculation : I suppose I could do the encryption by iterating over the data 16 bytes at a time and updating the iv each round by hashing the prior encrypted 16 byte block . However , that seems to be busy work that I would have expected the library to do . And I would have expected it to have been mentioned by the experts that present implementation guidelines .

"I had an example from the book 'java concurrency pratique ' , who says that volatile and immutable holder object gives thread safety . But I do not understand the example given by the book . The code is as follows : I understand thatThe key word volatile assure that the filed cache is visible to all threads.The class OneValueCache is immutable . But we can change the reference of the variable cache.But I can not understand why the class VolatileCachedFactorizer is thread safe.For two threads ( Thread A and Thread B ) , if thread A and thread B arrive at factors == null at the same time , the two threads A and B will both try to create the OneValueCache . Then Thread A arrives at factors = factor ( i ) while threadB arrives at cache = new OneValueCache ( i , factors ) at the same time . Then the thread A will create a OneValueCache which overwrites the value created by threadB ( OneValueChange is immutable but the reference to the variable cache can be changed ) .It shows that the code is not thread safe.Could anyone tell me why this piece of code is considered to be thread safe and why I am wrong ?"

"I 'm working on a Java application with Swing-based GUI .

"Lets say I have a method : Where X is a type of object that is extremely complex . By this I mean it is not something one can easily instantiate on the fly . I need to somehow unit test someMethod , but I can not so simply create an X object to put in as parameters . So I first think to try and mock the object , but the problem I run in to is the someMethod function calls many methods of anObject , meaning this X object that is being mocked has a latge amount of functions that need to be called , and thus need to be mock-expected . To make things worse , these X object methods being called return more X objects , meaning I have to mock objects , to expect mock method calls , to return more mock objects . Regarding this scenario I have a few questions , as I 'm new to the concept of unit testing : The lengthy unit test method aside , I find my unit test to not only be testing as to whether a method works or not , but also specifying the implementation ( because I 'm basically specifying most of the code that is being called in the method itself with the mock-expects ) . Is this a problem ( mostly to the concept of unit testing itself ) ? Is there any way to get around this , even if only to make my unit test methods be a lot less verbose and more maintainable ? I thought about taking a serialized X object from somewhere else , saving that , and then whenever I call my unit test method , I would unserialize my X object and run that as parameters . This is just some random idea I thought of the top of my head ; does anyone actually do this ? In case anyone is wondering what exactly I 'm doing , I 'm using the IDebugContextListener interface to grab debugging information regarding data on a stackframe at a given step on the java debugger . The `` X '' that I am referring to are objects that are defined by the interface here , including objects such as IValue , IVariable , and IStackframe . All these variables are provided to me by the Java debugger during runtime ."

Then I iterate from 0 to 10^7 inserting i into the Map or Array . I do it 10 times to be sure that outliers do n't mess the results.The output was unexpected since the Map had a better performance then Array : I made the same experiment in java : and the output was expected ( Array faster than Map ) : My question is : why the Map is faster than the Array when using Groovy ?
Why am I receiving a length of 3 instead of 4 ? How can I fix this to give the proper length ?

"I 'm actually very surprised I was unable to find the answer to this here , though maybe I 'm just using the wrong search terms or something . Closest I could find is this , but they ask about generating a specific range of doubles with a specific step size , and the answers treat it as such . I need something that will generate the numbers with arbitrary start , end and step size.I figure there has to be some method like this in a library somewhere already , but if so I was n't able to find it easily ( again , maybe I 'm just using the wrong search terms or something ) . So here 's what I 've cooked up on my own in the last few minutes to do this : These methods run a simple loop multiplying the step by the sequence index and adding to the start offset . This mitigates compounding floating-point errors which would occur with continuous incrementation ( such as adding the step to a variable on each iteration ) .I added the generateSequenceRounded method for those cases where a fractional step size can cause noticeable floating-point errors . It does require a bit more arithmetic , so in extremely performance sensitive situations such as ours , it 's nice to have the option of using the simpler method when the rounding is unnecessary . I suspect that in most general use cases the rounding overhead would be negligible.Note that I intentionally excluded logic for handling `` abnormal '' arguments such as Infinity , NaN , start > end , or a negative step size for simplicity and desire to focus on the question at hand.Here 's some example usage and corresponding output : Is there an existing library that provides this kind of functionality already ? If not , are there any issues with my approach ? Does anyone have a better approach to this ?"

Also , even if I replace the RoutingContext.class reference with Object.class , this does not fix the error.The only way I can get the lambda.handle ( ctx ) call to succeed is by changing HomeHandler so that it does not extend Handler , making HomeHandler : :handle static , and changing RoutingContext.class to Object.class .

"I am decoding base 64 encoded images on Android ( Java ) . It works for most of the images , but for some of the image binaries it returns null . If I use an online decoder , the binary in question works fine , which tells me the format is correct .

"Disclaimer : I 'm new to StackOverflow , at least in terms of asking my own questions , so if there 's anything wrong or 'bad practice ' about this one please give me some pointers.Recently at work I 've had cause to use Selenium and , being new to the tool , there have been a few times when I 've wound up scratching my head over why something is done a certain way . Usually the reason becomes apparent later , but not in this case.Currently I 'm writing some browser automation which involves indexing search combinations and noting how many results appear for that combination on various sites related to the company I 'm working for.For most of these sites , the searches will usually be defined via keywords and drop-down menus which I 'm handling via Selenium 's Select object . Specifically I 've been using the selectByIndex method to iterate through the various combinations.One thing that I noticed was that , using this method , the further down the list of options I got the longer the method took . When I opened up the declaration the code I found was as follows : What I 'm confused about is why this code is written so that it examines the 'index ' attribute . As far as I can tell the getOptions ( ) method returns a list of the options available to the selector based on tag so it should be accurate , and considering that I 've been listing the indexed search combinations using the same method and those have been accurate I 'm fairly sure it is.So , right now I 've extended the class and overloaded the method to just direct it straight to the corresponding index as I do have a non-trivial number of search combinations to check and any increase in speed is valuable . There do n't appear to be any issues cropping up with the overloaded code and everything seems to be accurate so I 'm wondering why this method is written in this way ? Could anyone enlighten me ?"

"Let 's say I have a event-emitting data source that I want to transform into reactive stream . Data source is bound by a resource ( for example a socket that periodically sends updated state ) so I would want to share single Subscription to that resource . Using single observable with replay ( for new subscribers to immediately get current value value ) and refCount operators seems to be well suited for that . For example this his how MyDataProvider singleton would look like : However , now let 's say I have another data source that needs result of the first data source to compute its own value : Here my setup starts to fall apart . Multicasting of the first observable only works until refCount operator . After that , everything is unicast again . That would mean that if two separate subscriptions to anotherDataProvider are made , flatMap operator would be called twice . I see two workarounds for this , but I dislike both:1 . Transform first observable before multicast happensSimplest workaround seems to be for me to save unicast variant of myDataObservable somewhere , before multicast operation is made and then perform that multicast operation in anotherDataObservable However if those two observables are located in diferent modules , this workaround would make the code very inelegant , requiring MyDataProvider to expose two different observables that seemingly return same data . 2 . Just use duplicate multicast operatorsSecond workaround seems to be to just apply those replay and refCount operators again in anotherDataObservable . But this creates inefficiency since first multicast operator in myDataObservable is already applied , but now does nothing , except waste memory and CPU cycles.Both workarounds also involve coupling of the AnotherDataProvider to the MyDataProvider . If in the future MyDataProvider changes and multicasting is no longer desired , I would also have to update AnotherDataProvider to remove multicasting operators from there.What would be the more elegant way to resolve this problem ? Could I have architectured that any better to avoid the issue altogether ?"

"Why is n't there an Objects.equal receiving as an argument each primitive type ?

"I 'm curious how are the static final fields treated by the JVM . I saw a similar question here but it 's not what I 'm looking for .

"My Practice Tests book contains this question on the ternary operator : It does not compile . The explanation given is the following : Ternary operations require both right-hand expressions to be of compatible data types . In this example , the first right-hand expression of the outer ternary operation is of type String , while the second right-hand expression is of type int . Since these data types are incompatible , the code does not compile , and Option C is the correct answer.Is that really the reason ?

"I have Java service running on Windows 7 that runs once per day on a SingleThreadScheduledExecutor .

If I run it on a 1 second interval the drift averages +11ms.Interestingly if I do the same on a Timer ( ) values are pretty consistent with an average drift less than a full millisecond.Linux : does n't drift ( nor with Executor , nor with Timer ) Windows : drifts like crazy with Executor , does n't with TimerTested with Java8 and Java11.Interestingly , if you assume a drift of 11ms per second you 'll get 950400ms drift per day which amounts to 15.84 minutes per day .

"Let 's say I need a class that is bounded to a generic Comparable type : The class has a method with own generics in signature : Now , is there a possibility to restrict the input of the submit method to accept only Callables that also implement T ? I first tried this : but found out it 's not possible ( for reasons described here ) . Is there any elegant possibility to bypass it ? EDIT : The one ugly possibility I can think about is to split the encapsulation in two different types and pass an object pair in submit : The main disadvantage is that the method signature becomes more complicated , also I will need some one-to-one mapping of Ts to Callables for some latter code . Maybe one can suggest a pattern that solves it in an appropriate way ? ..EDIT , take two : Let me explain briefly what I 'm trying to achieve . I 'm working on a custom thread pool implementation that is able to perform some kind of special task scheduling . To do so , this service accepts only one special sort of Callable tasks . Those Callables have to implement a custom interface that is similar to the Comparable one . By comparing pairs of tasks using methods in this interface , the service will : Block the incoming task if it is blocked by any running task.Invoke pending tasks on completion of a done task 's Future.Determine the execution order of pending tasks by comparing them.The blocking/comparison logic should be provided by the tasks themselves . This way the thread pool class should only define what special kind of Comparables the pool object is accepting , and it does n't care at all what kind of Callables they really are and what is their return type.EDIT , take three : Based on Erick Robertson 's answer , it 's now possible to prevent submitting of smelly tasks : Nice and easy !

"Consider : Clearly , each boxing instruction allocates a separate instance of a boxed Int32 , which is why reference-equality between them fails . This page appears to indicate that this is specified behaviour : The box instruction converts the 'raw ' ( unboxed ) value type into an object reference ( type O ) . This is accomplished by creating a new object and copying the data from the value type into the newly allocated object.But why does this have to be the case ? Is there any compelling reason why the CLR does not choose to hold a `` cache '' of boxed Int32s , or even stronger , common values for all primitive value-types ( which are all immutable ) ?

Some performance implication I have n't considered ( I doubt if testing that the item is in the cache etc . will result in a net performance loss , but what do I know ) ? Implementation difficulties ? Issues with unsafe code ? Breaking backwards compatibility ( I ca n't think of any good reason why a well-written program should rely on the existing behaviour ) ?

I learned about the VisitorStrategy and implemented a simple Visitor like so : and added this Visitor to a VisitorStrategyexpecting that this would skip nodes during deserialization .

Anyway , the VisitorStrategy seems to keep parsing the node to be skipped , resulting in a ValueRequiredException.How can I ignore nodes having a given attribute ?

"Intent : I 'm using the java.lang.instrument package to create some instrumentation for Java programs . The idea is that I use bytecode manipulation via this system in order to add method calls at the beginning and end of each method . Generally speaking , a modified Java method would look like : MyFancyProfiler is an entry point to a relatively complex system that gets initialized during the premain method ( which is part of java.lang.instrument ) .edit - MyFancyProfiler contains a static API that will get a reference to the rest of the system through a mechanism like the one described in the solution to this question . The reference is obtained as an Object , and the appropriate calls are made via reflection , so that even if the current ClassLoader does n't know about the underlying classes , it will still work.DifficultiesFor a simple Java program , the approach works fine . For `` real '' apps ( like windowed applications , and especially RCP/OSGi applications ) , I ran into issues with ClassLoaders . Some ClassLoaders wo n't know how to find the MyFancyProfiler class , so it will throw Exceptions when it tries to call the static methods in MyFancyProfiler.My solution to this ( and where my real problem is happening ) is currently to `` inject '' MyFancyProfiler into each encountered ClassLoader by reflectively calling defineClass . The gist of it is : edit for more info - The reason for this injection is to ensure that every class , no matter which ClassLoader loaded it , will be able to call MyFancyProfiler.methodEntered directly . Once it makes that call , MyFancyProfiler will need to use reflection to interact with the rest of the system , or else I will get an InvocationTargetException or NoClassDef exception when it tries to refer directly . I currently have it working so that the only `` direct '' dependencies of MyFancyProfiler are JRE system classes , so it seems to be fine.ProblemThis even works ! Most of the time ! But for at least two separate ClassLoaders that I encounter while trying to trace Eclipse ( launching the IDE from the command line ) , I get a NullPointerException coming from inside the ClassLoader.defineClass method : Line 500 of ClassLoader.java is a call to domains.add ( pd ) , where domains seems to be a Set that gets initialized at constructor time , and pd is a ProtectionDomain that ( as far as I can tell ) should be the `` default '' ProtectionDomain . So I do n't see an obvious way for that line to cause a NullPointerException . Currently I 'm stumped , and I 'm hoping that somebody can offer some insight into this.What could cause the defineClass to fail in this way ? And in case there 's no obvious solution , can you offer a potential alternative approach to my overall problem ?"

"XQuery , shared with XSLT and XPath 2.0 and later , supports various number data types , two of them are xs : double and xs : decimal . It is possible to cast an xs : double to an xs : decimal , as defined in http : //www.w3.org/TR/xquery-operators/ # casting-to-numerics . Implementations done in Java seem to implement xs : double using the Java double data type and xs : decimal using the java.math.BigDecimal class . That class supports two ways of converting a double into a BigDecimal , namely doing BigDecimal.valueOf ( doubleValue ) and new BigDecimal ( doubleValue ) . According to https : //stackoverflow.com/a/7186298/252228 , the former gives the more intuitive result while the latter gives the more correct result , as for instance BigDecimal.valueOf ( 1.1 ) results in 1.1 while new BigDecimal ( 1.1 ) results in 1.100000000000000088817841970012523233890533447265625.When I try the cast of an xs : double to an xs : decimal with Saxon and Exist then outputs 1.100000000000000088817841970012523233890533447265625 while with BaseX it outputs 1.1 . I suppose the difference results from the different implementations , BaseX doing BigDecimal.valueOf ( 1.1 ) , Saxon and Exist doing new BigDecimal ( 1.1 ) .My question is : which approach is the right one to implement the cast operation according to the http : //www.w3.org/TR/xquery-operators/ # casting-to-numerics ?"

"I 'm trying to come up with an algorithm for the following problem : I 've got a collection of triplets of integers - let 's call these integers A , B , C. The value stored inside can be big , so generally it 's impossible to create an array of size A , B , or C. The goal is to minimize the size of the collection . To do this , we 're provided a simple rule that allows us to merge the triplets : For two triplets ( A , B , C ) and ( A ' , B ' , C ' ) , remove the original triplets and place the triplet ( A | A ' , B , C ) if B == B ' and C = C ' , where | is bitwise OR . Similar rules hold for B and C also.In other words , if two values of two triplets are equal , remove these two triplets , bitwise OR the third values and place the result to the collection.The greedy approach is usually misleading in similar cases and so it is for this problem , but I ca n't find a simple counterexample that 'd lead to a correct solution . For a list with 250 items where the correct solution is 14 , the average size computed by greedy merging is about 30 ( varies from 20 to 70 ) .

"In order to keep implementation details from leaking , instead of returning , e.g. , a Collection < MyCoolObject > , one might implement Iterable < MyCoolObject > , which would then require implementing Iterator < T > from the Iterable Interface . Thus however the internal data structure is managed , the access to the elements is via the Iterator.With Java 8 , one might wish to add Stream < MyCoolObject > stream ( ) to MyCoolObject . ( See also : recommendation to support stream in the book Java 8 Lambdas ) . While adding the method is n't difficult ( and I did read the Question about Why Iterable Does n't Provide Stream ) , it seems odd that Java did not add an Interface for Streamable < T > to mirror the Iterable < T > idea . ( Well , a different name perhaps since Streamable exists for the ever use CORBA stuff ) . I think I followed the Answer about why adding Stream to Iterable was potentially problematic , but I do not see why a Streaming < T > interface could n't have been provided . For example , Collections could have implemented the Streaming < T > interface , and it would make it clearer for other objects that one could expect a stream ( ) method.Based upon an Answer to the above referenced Question , it is possible to get a Stream from the Iterable via but that seems like a lot of work given that MyObject could would like to just implement stream ( ) to allow a user of the object to dowithout the intervening conversion from the iterator.Is there a reason for the lack of an interface for streaming capable objects ? Is there a better approach than just implementing stream ( ) on MyCoolObject and letting someone look through the Javadoc so they know it has a stream ( ) method ? Or , is quite likely , am I misunderstanding something about the approach for Stream ?

"I 'd been programming in C # , but was frustrated by the limitations of its type system . One of the first things , I learned about Scala was that Scala has higher kinded generics . But even after I 'd looked at a number of articles , blog entries and questions I still was n't sure what higher kinded generics were . Anyway I 'd written some Scala code which compiled fine , Does this snippet use higher kinds ? And then I thought maybe I 'm already using higher kinded generics . As I understand it I was , but then as I now I understand it I had already been happily using higher kinded types in C # before I 'd even heard of Scala . Does this snipet use higher kinded type ? So to avert further confusion I thought it would be useful to clarify for each of Java , C # and Scala what they allow in terms of Higher kinded types , wild cards and the use of open / partially open types . As the key difference between C # and Scala seems to be that Scala allows wild cards and open types , where as C # has no wild card and requires all generic types to be closed before use . I know they are some what different but I think it would be useful to relate the existence of these features to their equivalent in C++ Templates.So is the following correct ?

No point belongs to both since the sets are disjoint.Recursively find the distance δL of a closest pair of points in PL and the distance δR of a closestpair in PR.Let δ = min ( δL , δR ) . The distance of a pair of closest points in the input set P is either that of the points found in the recursive step ( i.e. , δ ) or consists of the distance between a point in PL and a point in PR.The only candidate points one from PL and one from PR must be in a vertical strip consistingof a line at distance δ to the left of the line V and a line at distance δ to the right of VLet YV be an array of the points within the strip sorted by non-decreasing y coordinate ( i.e. , if i ≤ j then YV [ i ] ≤ YV [ j ] ) .Starting with the first point in YV and stepping trough all except the last , check the distance of this point with the next 7 points ( or any that are left if there are not as many as 7 ) .

As this isa set there can be no repetition of a point and we can not assume any ordering on the elements.public static PointSet gP ( String f ) .This opens a file called f and reads points from it.public Point nP ( PointSet P ) .This is used to iterate over the points in P.

"ContextSuppose you have a component with a great many options to modify its behavior . Think a table of data with some sorting , filtering , paging , etc . The options could then be isFilterable , isSortable , defaultSortingKey , etc etc . Of course there will be a parameter object to encapsulate all of these , let 's call it TableConfiguration . Of course we do n't want to have a huge constructor , or a set of telescopic constructors , so we use a builder , TableConfigurationBuilder . The example usage could be : So far so good , a ton of SO questions deals with this already.Moving forwardThere is now a ton of Tables and each of them uses its own TableConfiguration . However , not all of the `` configuration space '' is used uniformly : let 's say most of the tables is filterable , and most of those are paginated . Let 's say , there are only 20 different combinations of configuration options that make sense and are actually used . In line with the DRY principle , these 20 combinations live in methods like these : QuestionHow to manage these 20 methods , so that developers adding new tables can easily find the configuration combination they need , or add a new one if it does not exist yet ? All of the above I use already , and it works reasonably well if I have an existing table to copy-paste ( `` it 's exactly like Customers '' ) . However , every time something out of the ordinary is required , it 's hard to figure out : Is there a method doing exactly what I want ? ( problem A ) If not , which one is the closest one to start from ? ( problem B ) I tried to give the methods some very descriptive names to express what configuration options are being built in inside , but it does not scale really well ... EditWhile thinking about the great answers below , one more thing occurred to me : Bonus points for grouping tables with the same configuration in a type-safe way . In other words , while looking at a table , it should be possible to find all its `` twins '' by something like go to definition and find all references ."

"I was looking at the String Javadoc when I noticed this bit about String concatenation : The Java language provides special support for the string concatenation operator ( + ) , and for conversion of other objects to strings . String concatenation is implemented through the StringBuilder ( or StringBuffer ) From the Java 8 JLS 15.8.1 , it is a choice given to the compiler ( emphasis mine ) : An implementation may choose to perform conversion and concatenation in one step to avoid creating and then discarding an intermediate String object . To increase the performance of repeated string concatenation , a Java compiler may use the StringBuffer class or a similar technique to reduce the number of intermediate String objects that are created by evaluation of an expression.I made a small program to see what it compiles down toAnd the output when running javap -c Tester shows that StringBuilder is being used : I 've looked at a handful of questions that tell the story that StringBuilder is generally faster because of synchronization in StringBuffer , and that is substituted for these string concatenations : When is StringBuffer/StringBuilder not implicitly used by the compiler ? What happens when Java Compiler sees many String concatenations in one line ? Java : String concat vs StringBuilder - optimised , so what should I do ? Best practices/performance : mixing StringBuilder.append with String.concatStringBuilder vs String concatenation in toString ( ) in JavaStringBuilder and StringBufferSo , considering the things I 've read that show that StringBuilder is generally the better choice leads me to wonder a couple things : When and why would a compiler choose to use StringBuffer instead of StringBuilder ? Would n't it make more sense if the compiler had the choice of using any AbstractStringBuilder implementation ?"
I 'm trying to port Codename One client builds which are very customized ant scripts to work with gradle . When you run a Codename One app on the simulator you are n't running the apps main class but rather something like : To do this in gradle I edited the basic build script as such : Then at the bottom I did this : This worked as expected and launched the simulator when pressing run in the IDE ( NetBeans ) . I 'm not sure if this is the `` right thing '' to do though and if it will work in other IDE's.Then when I tried launching in the debugger the arguments were n't passed since I 'm guessing the run target was n't invoked ? I tried doing this : Which obviously failed . I 'm not exactly sure where to pass arguments to the debugger ? Is this standardized by gradle ? Am I in the right direction regarding argument passing ?

"I have a JTree in a JScrollPane . The JTree is rather long so it takes a while to drag a node from the top of the tree to the bottom . When dragging a node the JScrollPane scrolls , but not nearly as fast as it scrolls using the mouse wheel . Implementing setUnitIncrement as suggested in the selected answer here makes the mouse wheel scroll speed even faster , but does not change the speed of dragging a node . The same is true when implementing setBlockIncrement . The speed of the scroll when dragging a node is about the same as if I were to hold the up or down arrow and traverse the JTree in that manner.How can I speed up the speed of dragging a node ? UPDATE 1 : Here is an SSCCE as requested . Most of this code I ripped off from here because it is good at illustrating the problem I am having . Just drag a node to a part of the tree that is n't visible in the scroll pane and you will see how slow scrolling is . This is what I want to speed up.SUCCESS ! I was able finally able to speed up the scrolling when dragging . In fact I was also able to make the scroll speed variable based on how close the cursor is to the top or bottom of the tree .

"I need some help to complete my idea about regexes.IntroductionThere was a question about better syntax for regexes on SE , but I do n't think I 'd use the fluent syntax.It 's surely nice for newbies , but in case of a complicated regex , you replace a line of gibberish by a whole page of slightly better gibberish.I like the approach by Martin Fowler , where a regex gets composed of smaller pieces.His solution is readable , but hand-made ; he proposes a smart way to build a complicated regex instead of a class supporting it.I 'm trying to make it to a class using something like ( see his example first ) where fluent syntax is used for combining regexes extended as follows : define named patterns and use them by enclosing in backticks ` name ` creates a named groupmnemonics : shell captures the result of the command enclosed in backticks ` : name ` creates a non-capturing groupmnemonics : similar to ( ? : ... ) ` -name ` creates a backreferencemnemonics : the dash connects it to the previous occurrenceredefine individual characters and use it everywhere unless quotedhere only some characters ( e.g. , ~ @ # % '' ) are allowedredefining + or ( would be extremely confusing , so it 's not allowedredefining space to mean any spacing is very natural in the example aboveredefining a character could make the pattern more compact , which is good unless overusede.g. , using something like define ( ' # ' , `` \\\\ '' ) for matching backslashes could make the pattern much readableredefine some quoted sequences like \s or \wthe standard definitions are not Unicode conformsometimes you might have you own idea what a word or space isThe named patterns serves as a sort of local variables helping to decompose a complicated expression into small and easy to understand pieces.A proper naming pattern makes often a comment unnecessary.QuestionsThe above should n't be hard to implement ( I did already most of it ) and could be really useful , I hope.Do you think so ? However , I 'm not sure how it should behave inside of brackets , sometimes it 's meaningful to use the definitions and sometimes not , e.g . inexpanding the space to \s makes sense , but expanding the tilde doesn't.Maybe there should be a separate syntax to define own character classes somehow ? Can you think of some examples where the named pattern are very useful or not useful at all ? I 'd need some border cases and some ideas for improvement.Reaction to tchrist 's answerComments to his objectionsLack of multiline pattern strings.There are no multiline strings in Java , which I 'd like to change , but can not.Freedom from insanely onerous and error-prone double-backslashing ... This is again something I ca n't do , I can only offer a workaround , s. below.Lack of compile-time exceptions on invalid regex literals , and lack of compile-time caching of correctly compiled regex literals.As regexes are just a part of the standard library and not of the language itself , there 's nothing what can done here.No debugging or profiling facilities.I can do nothing here.Lack of compliance with UTS # 18.This can be easily solved by redefining the corresponding patterns as I proposed . It 's not perfect , since in debugger you 'll see the blowed up replacements.I looks like you do n't like Java . I 'd be happy to see some syntax improvements there , but there 's nothing I can do about it . I 'm looking for something working with current Java.RFC 5322Your example can be easily written using my syntax : DisadvantagesWhile rewriting your example I encountered the following issues : As there are no \xdd escape sequences \udddd must be usedUsing another character instead of backslash is a bit strangeAs I prefer to write it bottom-up , I had to take your lines revertedWithout much idea what it does , I except myself having done some errorsOn the bright side : - Ignoring spaces is no problem- Comments are no problem- The readability is goodAnd most important : It 's plain Java and uses the existing regex-engine as is ."

"Against my expectations , the following programstill prints outmeaning object1 and object2 are not GC-ed.However , when removing the for loop from the program , those objects can be GC-ed and the program prints.Moving the for loop to a separate method has the same effect : the objects are GC-ed at the end of the program.What I suspect is happening is that that for loop stores those objects on the stack , and does not remove them afterwards . And since the object is still present on the stack , it can not be GC-ed.Looking at the byte code ( which I am really not that good at ) seems to support this hypothesis : I see astore commands , but I could n't spot a place in the byte code where those are removed from the stack again.However , I have two issues with my theory : From what I understood from that byte code , I would have expected that object1 is removed from the stack ( overwritten by object2 ) , and only the last object accessed in the loop ( object2 ) would not be GC-ed.Changing the for loop todoes n't change the output of the program . I would have thought that that would clear that reference to the object on the stack.Question : anybody has a solid theory on why that for-loop ensures that those objects can not be GC-ed ? My theory has a few gaping holes in them.Context : This problem was encountered in a unit tests which we use to detect memory leaks , based on the Netbeans method NBTestCase # assertGC . This assertGC method will fail when an object is still referenced on the heap or on the stack.In our test , we have code likewhich kept on failing , until we removed the for-loop.We already have a workaround ( move the for-loop to a separate method ) , but I would like to understand why our original code does not work ."

I imagine we are looking at something like this : Lets assume this is the typical doubly linked list data structure in Java , where Node is a class ( inner or separate class ) and the only instance variables in the DoublyLinkedList class are andHe was saying that because in the inner portion of the list each node has a reference to a next node , and that node has a reference to the previous node . He said this would n't be the case in a singly linked list because the references are only `` a one way street '' and once you lose reference to the first one , they all end up getting garbage collected.Of course , everyone in the class shared their opinion but no one in the class is anyone I would ever listen to or take programming advice from , and I seem to get conflicting information between when I ask a question on Stack Overflow versus what my professor tells me . I 'll be honest , I do n't have enough experience to chime in on the matter but simply put , I do n't know if I always believe everything he says because he was wrong on one or two other things I asked him about.So , does setting andclear the entire list from memory ? If so how can I verify this ? If not , then what is the general idea of a solution to get rid of the list ? Node by node deletion ? Please leave your thoughts and comments ."

"I have a data source configuration class that looks as follows , with separate DataSource beans for testing and non-testing environments using JOOQ .

A method is no longer transactional , and TransactionSynchronizationManager.getResourceMap ( ) holds two separate values : one showing to my connection pool ( which is not transactional ) , and one showing the TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy ) .In this case , I would have expected only a single resource of type TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy which wraps my DB CP.After much trial and error using the second set of configuration changes I made ( noted below with `` AFTER '' ) , @ Transactional works correctly as expected even during runtime , though TransactionSynchronizationManager.getResourceMap ( ) holds the following value : In this case , my DataSourceTransactionManager seems to not even know the TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy ( most likely due to my passing it the simple DataSource , and not the proxy object ) , which seems to completely 'skip ' the proxy anyway.My question is : the initial configuration that I had seemed correct , but did not work .

"I have a fairly simple hobby project written in Java 8 that makes extensive use of repeated Math.round ( ) calls in one of its modes of operation .

Anyway , prior to Java 8u40 , the code that resembles the above could complete the full run of ~103 billion instruction blocks in about 13 seconds on an AMD A10-7700k . With Java 8u40 it takes around 260 seconds to do the same thing . No changes to code , no nothing , just a Java update.Has anyone else noticed Math.round ( ) getting much slower , especially when it is used repetitiously ? It 's almost as though the JVM was doing some sort of optimization before that it is n't doing anymore .

You can download the first attempt here : https : //www.dropbox.com/s/rm2ftcv8y6ye1bi/MathRoundMVCE.zip ? dl=0The second attempt is below . My first attempt has been otherwise removed from this post as it has been deemed to be too long , and is prone to dead code removal optimizations by the JVM ( which apparently are happening less in 8u40 ) .Long story short , this code performed about the same in 8u25 as in 8u40 . As you can see , I am now recording the results of all calculations into arrays , and then summing those arrays outside of the timed portion of the loop to a local variable which is then written to a static variable at the end of the outer loop . Under 8u25 : Total execution time is 261545 millisecondsUnder 8u40 : Total execution time is 266890 millisecondsTest conditions were the same as before . So , it would appear that 8u25 and 8u31 were doing dead code removal that 8u40 stopped doing , causing the code to `` slow down '' in 8u40 . That does n't explain every weird little thing that 's cropped up but that appears to be the bulk of it .

Am not sure how to go about doing this in an efficient way ( in java ) , letalone if this is a good method to achieve my desired result . Is there a way to convert the array of booleans to ints ? If not , is the easiest alternative to instantiate a new array of ints , and loop through the boolean array to populate the new array ?"
"I have the need to perform algorithms on various primitive types ; the algorithm is essentially the same with the exception of which type the variables are . So for instance , How can I avoid this repetition ? I know there 's no way to genericize primitive arrays , so my hands seem tied .

"Consider the following constructor for the class Foo ( which for the sake of clarity is not a generic class ) : This is valid syntax for constructors , just like with normal generic methods.But what is the use of this syntax ? Typically generic methods provide type safety for their return type , and can benefit from type inference by the compiler . For example : But a call to a constructor always returns an instance of its declaring class , so its type parameters have no effect on the return type . The constructor above could just be replaced with its erasure : Of course generics are n't only about type safety for return types . The constructor might just want to constrain the type of argument ( s ) being passed in . However , the above reasoning still applies for a bounded type parameter : Even nested type parameters with bounds are handled using wildcards : So what is a legitimate use case for having a generic constructor ?"

"After reading this question , I 've started to think about generic methods in Java 8 . Specifically , what happens with generic type parameters when methods are chained . For this question , I will use some generic methods from Guava 's ImmutableMap , but my question is more general and can be applied to all chained generic methods.Consider ImmutableMap.of generic method , which has this signature : If we use this generic method to declare a Map , the compiler infers the generic types correctly : I 'm aware that from Java 8 onwards , the compiler inference mechanism has been improved , i.e . it infers the generic types of methods from the context , which in this case is an assignment . The context can also be a method call : In this case , the generic types of ImmutableMap.of are inferred from the generic types of the argument of someMethod , ie . Map < String , String > map.But when I attempt to use ImmutableMap.builder ( ) and chain methods to build my map , I get a compilation error : The error is : ( I 've removed the packages names from the error message for the sake of clarity ) .I understand the error and why it happens . The first method in the chain is ImmutableMap.builder ( ) and the compiler has no context to infer the type parameters , so it fallbacks to < Object , Object > . Then , the ImmutableMap.Builder.put method is invoked with arguments `` a '' and `` b '' and finally the ImmutableMap.Builder.build ( ) method is called , which returns an ImmutableMap < Object , Object > . This is why I 'm receiving the incompatible types error : when I attempt to assign this ImmutableMap < Object , Object > instance to my Map < String , String > map variable , the compiler complains.I even know how to solve this error : I could either break the method chain into two lines , so that the compiler can now infer the generic type parameters : Or I could explicitly provide the generic type parameters : So my question is not how to solve/workaround this , but why I do need to provide the generic type parameters explicitly when chaining generic methods . Or , in other words , why ca n't the compiler infer the generic type parameters in a method chain , especially when the method chain is at the right side of an assignment ? If it were possible , would this break something else ( I mean , related to the generics type system ) ? EDIT : There 's a question asking the same , however the only answer it has does n't clearly explain why the compiler does n't infer the generic type parameters in a method chain . All it has is a reference to a small paragraph in the JSR-000335 Lambda Expressions for the JavaTM Programming Language Final Release for Evaluation ( spec part D ) : There has been some interest in allowing inference to `` chain '' : in a ( ) .b ( ) , passing type information from the invocation of b to the invocation of a . This adds another dimension to the complexity of the inference algorithm , as partial information has to pass in both directions ; it only works when the erasure of the return type of a ( ) is fixed for all instantiations ( e.g . List ) . This feature would not fit very well into the poly expression model , since the target type can not be easily derived ; but perhaps with additional enhancements it could be added in the future.So I think I might rephrase my original question as follows : What would these additional enhancements be ? How is it that passing partial information in both directions would make the inference algorithm more complex ? Why would this only work when the erasure of the return type of a ( ) is fixed for all instantiations ( e.g . List ) ? In fact , what does it mean that the erasure of the return type of a method is fixed for all instantiations ? Why would n't this feature fit very well into the poly expression model ? Actually , what is the poly expression model ? And why could n't the target type be easily derived in this case ?"
"Sometimes we have several classes that have some methods with the same signature , but that do n't correspond to a declared Java interface . For example , both JTextField and JButton ( among several others in javax.swing . * ) have a method Now , suppose I wish to do something with objects that have that method ; then , I 'd like to have an interface ( or perhaps to define it myself ) , e.g.so that I could write : But , sadly , I ca n't : This cast would be illegal . The compiler knows that JButton is not a CanAddActionListener , because the class has not declared to implement that interface ... however it `` actually '' implements it.This is sometimes an inconvenience - and Java itself has modified several core classes to implement a new interface made of old methods ( String implements CharSequence , for example ) .My question is : why this is so ? I understand the utility of declaring that a class implements an interface . But anyway , looking at my example , why ca n't the compiler deduce that the class JButton `` satisfies '' the interface declaration ( looking inside it ) and accept the cast ? Is it an issue of compiler efficiency or there are more fundamental problems ? My summary of the answers : This is a case in which Java could have made allowance for some `` structural typing '' ( sort of a duck typing - but checked at compile time ) . It did n't . Apart from some ( unclear for me ) performance and implementations difficulties , there is a much more fundamental concept here : In Java , the declaration of an interface ( and in general , of everything ) is not meant to be merely structural ( to have methods with these signatures ) but semantical : the methods are supposed to implement some specific behavior/intent . So , a class which structurally satisfies some interface ( i.e. , it has the methods with the required signatures ) does not necessarily satisfies it semantically ( an extreme example : recall the `` marker interfaces '' , which do not even have methods ! ) . Hence , Java can assert that a class implements an interface because ( and only because ) this has been explicitly declared . Other languages ( Go , Scala ) have other philosophies ."

"If I have the following Scala class : Then I only need to define the id method in Scala to get a concrete class . But if I try to extend it in Java , the compiler says that all the concrete methods of Ordered are missing . So , does that mean that the Scala compiler is only putting the implementation of the concrete methods of Ordered in concrete Scala classes ? This seems very wasteful , because I could have dozens of concrete classes implementing MyOrdered , and they would all get a copy of the same code , when in fact it would be enough to just put it directly in the base class MyOrdered . Also , this makes it very difficult to create a Java-friendly Scala API . Is there any way to force the Scala compiler to put the method definitions where it should have done so anyway , apart from making the class concrete by using dummy method implementations ? Even funnier is declaring a concrete method final in a Scala trait . In that case , it is still not implemented in an abstract Scala class that extends the trait , but it can not be implemented in a Java class that extends the abstract Scala class because it is flagged as final . This is definitely a compiler bug . Final abstract methods make no sense , even if they are legal in the JVM , apparently ."

"I have many PDF documents in my system , and I notice sometimes that documents are image-based without editing capability . In this case , I do OCR for better search in Foxit PhantomPDF where you can do OCR in multiple files . I would like to find all PDF documents of mine which are image-based . I do not understand how the PDF reader can recognize that the document 's OCR is not textual . There must be some fields which these readers access . This can be accessed in terminal too . This answer gives open proposals how to do it in the thread Check if a PDF file is a scanned one : Your best bet might be to check to see if it has text and also see if it contains a large pagesized image or lots of tiled images which cover the page . If you also check the metadata this should cover most options.I would like to understand better how you can do this effectively , since if there exists some metafield , then it would be easy . However , I have not found such a metafield . I think the most probable approach is to see if the page contains pagesized image which has OCR for search because it is effective and used in some PDF readers already . However , I do not know how to do it . Edge Detection and Hugh Transform about the answerIn Hugh transform , there are specifically chosen parameters in the hyper-square of the parameter space . Its complexity $ O ( A^ { m-2 } ) $ where m is the amount of parameters where you see that with more than there parameters the problem is difficult . A is the size of the image space . Foxit reader is using most probably 3 parameters in their implementation . Edges are easy to detect well which can ensure the efficiency and must be done before Hugh transform . Corrupted pages are simply ignored . Other two parameters are still unknown but I think they must be nodes and some intersections . How these intersections are computed is unknown ?

"I have a very simple Checkclass which has a blocking waitForCondition ( ) method . This method is blocking . I want to create some unit tests for this method . First , the method should return when the condition is met . Second , the method should return when it is interrupted . Internally the Check class has an ArrayBlockingQueue and calls its take ( ) method , so my test is really about having coded the logic for the condition correctly ( as it should be ) .In the application , data for the Check class is fed by another thread via an InputData method . The InputData method executes the logic on incoming data and places a dummy object in the ArrayBlockingQueue when the condition is met . This should cause waitForCondition ( ) to return.So my first thought is I can test the InputData by mocking and check to see the dummy object is added to the queue when the condition is met . This would require changing the design of the class , since the queue is a private data member ( unless it is possible to mock private data ) . Instead of InputData adding directly to the queue when the condition is met , it would have to call something which could be mocked.But then there is the problem of checking the waitForCondition ( ) methods themselves , given that InputData is functioning correctly . It 's really simply code : So I 'm wondering if it 's worth the imagined trouble : a test which creates another thread with a Check , calls its waitForCondition ( ) , then returns something when it 's done . Perhaps , using an Executor service . The fuzzy part is how to synchronize the assertTrue ( ... ) . I found this article on asynchronous testing which looks like it might do the trick . Summary of question : Should I change the design to test the logic in InputData ( ) and if so , how ? Should I leave out the test of waitForCondition ( ) as long as InputData ( ) is tested ? Or is it better to just do what needs to be done ( a somewhat complicated unit test ) and test waitForCondition ( ) directly ?"

"This question is , at it 's core , a design question . I 'll use a Java/Java EE example to illustrate the question.Consider a web-mail application which is built using JPA for persistence and EJB for the services layer . Let 's say we have a service method in our EJB like this : This is seemingly a reasonable business method . Presumably , the Mailbox object will still be attached and it will seamlessly save the changes back to the database . After all , that is the promise of transparent persistence.The Mailbox object would have this method : Here 's where it gets complicated -- assume we want to have other mailbox types . Say we have an AutoRespondingMailbox which automatically responds to the sender , and a HelpDeskMailbox which automatically opens a helpdesk ticket with each email received.The natural thing to do would be to extend Mailbox , where AutoRespondingMailbox has this method : The problem is that our Maibox object and it 's subclasses are `` domain objects '' ( and in this example , also JPA entities ) . The Hibernate guys ( and many others ) preach a non-dependent domain model -- that is , a domain model that does not depend on container/runtime provided services . The issue with such a model is that the AutoRespndingMailbox.addMessage ( ) method can not send an email because it ca n't access , for example , JavaMail.The exact same issue would occur with HelpDeskMailbox , as it could not access WebServices or JNDI injection to communicate with the HelpDesk system.So you 're forced to put this functionality in the service layer , like this : Having to use instanceof in that way is the first sign of a problem . Having to modify this service class each time you want to subclass Mailbox is another sign of a problem.Does anyone have best practices for how these situations are handled ? Some would say that the Mailbox object should have access to the container services , and this can be done with some fudging , but it 's definitely fighting the intended usage of JPA to do that , as the container provides dependency injection everywhere except in Entities , clearly indicating that this is n't an expected use case . So , what are we expected to do instead ? Liter-up our service methods and give-up polymorphism ? Our objects automatically become relegated to C-style structs and we lose most of the benefit of OO.The Hibernate team would say that we should split our business logic between the domain layer and the service layer , putting all of the logic that 's not dependent on the container into the domain entities , and putting all the logic that is dependent on the container into the services layer . I can accept that , if someone can give me an example of how to do that without having to completely give-up polymorphism and resorting to instanceof and other such nastiness"

"String De-duplication : Strings consume a lot of memory in any application.Whenever the garbage collector visits String objects it takes note of the char arrays . It takes their hash value and stores it alongside with a weak reference to the array . As soon as it finds another String which has the same hash code it compares them char by char.If they match as well , one String will be modified and point to the char array of the second String . The first char array then is no longer referenced anymore and can be garbage collected.String Pool : All strings used by the java program are stored here . If two variables are initialized to the same string value . Two strings are not created in the memory , there will be only one copy stored in memory and both will point to the same memory location.So java already takes care of not creating duplicate strings in the heap by checking if the string exists in the string pool . Then what is the purpose of string de-duplication ? If there is a code as followstwo strings are created in memory even though they are same . I can not think of any scenario other than this where string de-duplication is useful . Obviously I must be missing something . What I am I missing ? Thanks In Advance"

This second error in Exhibit C makes sense , Overloaded : :strangelyAmbiguous is n't assignable to Processor , but if it is n't assignable , why is it still considered ambiguous ? It would seem that the method reference inference only looks at the arity of the FunctionalInterface when determining which overloaded version to select . In the variable assignment , arity and type of parameters are checked , which causes this discrepancy between the overloaded method and the variable assignment.This seems to me like a bug .

"Originally I had posted the question on CodeReview , but this is more suited for StackOverflow probably.I 'm coding for a multi-step process , using Java 6 . Say there are 3 of these steps.Each accepts the same type of input.Lets begin.This is the object which is passed as input to each step . This object acts as a wrapper for another type of object , alongside some steps ' shared values.Be aware names are translated to a more generic domain and in english , originals are in Italian.This is the interface used by each step.Now , 2 out of the 3 steps must accept an EntityStepInput which contains a Entity or any type derived from it.The last step must accept an EntityStepInput which contains a specific type derived from Entity.The usage is pretty straighforward . I have overloaded methods which accept different types of Entitys . What follows is a simplified version.As you can see the DerivedEntity type is able to use all of the steps.And here another type of Entity can not use the last step , which is what I want.Now , this has became quite complex with generics .

"With Java 9 there was a change in the way javax.xml.transform.Transformer with OutputKeys.INDENT handles CDATA tags . In short , in Java 8 a tag named 'test ' containing some character data would result in : < test > < ! [ CDATA [ data ] ] > < /test > But with Java 9 the same results in < test > < ! [ CDATA [ data ] ] > < /test > Which is not the same XML . See http : //java9.wtf/xml-transformer/ for more information.I understood that for Java 9 there was a workaround using a DocumentBuilderFactory with setIgnoringElementContentWhitespace=true but this no longer works for Java 11.Does anyone know a way to deal with this in Java 11 ?

"I have been trying to learn as much as possible about Android development with specific focus on performance since many apps in the Play store today are sluggish . I have found/been directed to many articles/videos.One specific article about image caching is at : http : //android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/07/multithreading-for-performance.htmlThe author has code available at : http : //code.google.com/p/android-imagedownloader/source/browse/trunk/src/com/example/android/imagedownloader/ImageDownloader.javaWhich Google seemed to take a version of into and put into their sample classes at : http : //developer.android.com/resources/samples/XmlAdapters/src/com/example/android/xmladapters/ImageDownloader.htmlIn general it is solid , except for what I think is a flaw in the caching . It uses a soft / hard cache that puts / gets things into the hard cache because the Android system resets the soft cache quite often.Looking at the code though , one starts to wonder if the hard cache would get accidentally reset every time the parent class is instantiated.First the soft cache : Now take a look at the hard cache : The hard cache is not static , while the soft cache is static . So the hard cache instance and therefore items get cleared with the life of the instance of the class.The reason I think this is true is that I noticed my application with a ListView/ImageView , was downloading the image every time and never caching it . It was all done asynchronously , but still hitting the net every time . I verified this by putting a Log.d ( ) statement inside my method that hits the web and seeing when/how often it was called.Adding the static keyword fixed the issue and my application is much more performant . I am not sure why this is the case as there is only one instance of the ImageDownloader class in my adapter as shown in the example : THE QUESTIONWith all of that said , has anyone else experienced this ? ? ? Or am I a combination of crazy/wrong somehow . I am no Java/Android/JVM/Dalvik/WeakReference/SoftReference expert , but something seems a bit off .

"NoteBy saying that a memory access can ( or can not ) be reordered I meand that it can bereordered either by the compiler when emitting byte code byte or by the JIT when emitting machine code or by the CPU when executing out of order ( eventually requiring barriers to prevent this ) with respect to any other memory access.If often read that accesses to volatile variables can not be reordered due to the Happens-Before relationship ( HBR ) . I found that an HBR exists between every two consecutive ( in program order ) actions ofa given thread and yet they can be reordered.Also a volatile access HB only with accesses on the same variable/field.What I thinks makes the volatile not reorderable is this A write to a volatile field ( §8.3.1.4 ) happens-before every subsequent read [ of any thread ] of that field.If there are others threads a reordering of the variables will becomes visible as in thissimple exampleSo is not the HBR itself that prevent the ordering but the fact that volatile extends this relationship with other threads , the presence of other threads is the element that prevent reordering.If the compiler could prove that a reordering of a volatile variable would not change theprogram semantic it could reorder it even if there is an HBR.If a volatile variable is never accessed by other threads than its accessescould be reorderedI think c=3 could very well be reordered before a=1 , this quote from the specsconfirm this It should be noted that the presence of a happens-before relationship between two actions does not necessarily imply that they have to take place in that order in an implementation . If the reordering produces results consistent with a legal execution , it is not illegal.So I made these simple java programsIn both cases both fields are marked as volatile and accessed with putstatic.Since these are all the information the JIT has1 , the machine code would be identical , thus the vtest1 accesses will not be optimized2.My questionAre volatile accesses really never reordered by specification or they could be3 , but this is never done in practice ? If volatile accesses can never be reordered , what parts of the specs say so ? and would this means that all volatile accesses are executed and seen in program order by the CPUs ? 1Or the JIT can known that a field will never be accessed by other thread ? If yes , how ? .2Memory barriers will be present for example.3For example if no other threads are involved ."

How can I make my object mapper work in situation when there is another object mapper defined in jar from dependencies ? I 'm trying to use Swagger with Jersey 2 which is being run under Jetty .

Later when http request handler attempts to serialize instance of my class call ends up in ProviderBase.locateMapper which has following bodyin correct code-flow _mapperConfig.getConfiguredMapper ( ) returns null which subsequently causes invocation of _locateMapperViaProvider which finds my custom mapper . With Swagger it defaults to com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs.json.JsonMapperConfigurator and my custom json serializers never get invoked.I created small project which reproduces this problem here.How would you guys suggest to fix this ?

"I am currently working on a tool that produces Java byte code directly . When considering performance , I could for example translate the following Java equivalentin two different ways . Without applying optimizations , I could translate the stated code into the following byte code equivalentwhere the array would in the end be the only value on the operand stack . This translation requires an operand stack size of 4 since there is a maximum of four values ( int [ ] , int [ ] , int , int ) on the stack but this solution would not consume any local variable slots.I could however also translate the code snippet like this : This translation would reduce the size requirement for the operand stack by one slot but instead it would cost a local variable slot for storing the intermediate result.Not thinking of the reusability of such slots and local variables within a method : How should I consider the costs of the operand stack versus the local variable array ? Is operand stack size cheaper since it is not random access memory ? Thank you for your help !"

"A simple expression likeis interpreted differently depending on whether x is a type name or not . If x is not a type name , ( x ) - y just subtracts y from x . But if x is a type name , ( x ) - y computes the negative of y and casts the resulting value to type x.In a typical C or C++ compiler , the question of whether x is a type or not is answerable because the parser communicates such information to the lexer as soon as it processes a typedef or struct declaration . ( I think that such required violation of levels was the nastiest part of the design of C. ) But in Java , x may not be defined until later in the source code . How does a Java compiler disambiguate such an expression ? It 's clear that a Java compiler needs multiple passes , since Java does n't require declaration-before-use . But that seems to imply that the first pass has to do a very sloppy job on parsing expressions , and then in a later pass do another , more accurate , parse of expressions . That seems wasteful.Is there a better way ?"

"I have to make a simulator in Java , which will simulate car riding on highway . There should be 3 lanes on highway , in every lane there are cars with constant speed .

"I have a Spring app -- not a Spring Boot app -- that I 'm trying to declare a section of the API as OAuth2 protected using Spring Security . My authorization and general resource access config works great when I define http elements in the XML , but when I try to implement the resource access blocks using ResourceServerConfigureAdapter # configure ( HttpSecurity ) -- complete with @ EnableResourceServer etc , that configure method never even fires ( end to end tests also fail ) . Example Java config below : I have tried declaring a few different ways of effecting the config , but no dice . Namely , I have tried both top level @ Configuration classes extending ResourceServerConfigurerAdapter and bean methods returning ResourceServerConfiguration as in Dave Syer 's example ; I 've also tried explicitly setting order to Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE on the appropriate beans . It 's quite possibly important to note that most of the application 's legacy security config is defined via XML elements like the above . Another possible red flag about my configuration -- in order to get the token endpoint to authenticate against basic auth client_id : client_secret I had to wire my own BasicAuthFilter ( ProviderManager ( DaoAuthProvider ( ClientUserDetailsService ( clientDetailsService ) ) ) ) ) when , because it 's the vanilla and 'right ' way to authenticate the token endpoint , I 'd expect spring config to just default to it . Anyway , in no situation can I get ResourceServerConfigureAdapter # configure ( HttpSecurity ) to fire . My going theories are : Something about the preceding XML HTTP blocks is preventing myconfigure method from ever even being calledThis is simply a Spring Boot only feature -- although I 've seen no language to that effect There 's straight up some object in the application context that I 'm missing ( again , the operative annotations that I have at work -- besides the obvious @ Configuration and @ Bean -- are @ EnableWebSecurity , @ EnableAuthenticationServer , and @ EnableResourceServer ) .I 've made some configuration error ( duh ) .Any examples would be much appreciatedExample OAuth2 configuration class ( one of a few different iterations ) below : Analogogous < http > config that is picked up :"

"I run the code above with JDK1.8 , and I think I will get two `` falses '' as result , because in my opinion , it is obvious that s1 & str1 are located in the heap , and s2 & str2 are interned in the string pool , but I got a `` false '' and a `` true '' . The question comes : what causes the `` true '' ? Above is the primitive question.Now to identify this question is far from these called duplicated questions , I would like to talk about my new finding : the second part of the code gets a `` false '' result with JDK1.6 while a `` true '' result with JDK1.8 . Some blogs say the behaviour of intern ( ) has changed after the release of JDK1.7 . If the pool dose n't contain a string equals to this String object , this String object will not added to the pool and a reference to this String object will be added to the pool instead . It means the reference in the pool will be assigned to the string object located somewhere else ( like the heap ) , and next time the initialization of a literal string equals the early one will also be assigned to the string object. , which exactly describes the code part2 about the `` true '' result.This theory does work on my way to explain result of the code above . But it is obvious that the theory is out of what the intern ( ) doc contains , which is almost the same in JDK6/8 API.Now the question comes as : Is there any better explaination for the different results of the same code in JDK1.6 & JDK 1.8 ? Is the theory I mentioned above exactly what truly to happen ?"
"Recently , I 've been surprised by the fact that some Java collections do n't have constant time operation of method size ( ) .While I learned that concurrent implementations of collections made some compromises as a tradeoff for gain in concurrency ( size being O ( n ) in ConcurrentLinkedQueue , ConcurrentSkipListSet , LinkedTransferQueue , etc . ) good news is that this is properly documented in API documentation.What concerned me is the performance of method size on views returned by some collections ' methods . For example , TreeSet.tailSet returns a view of the portion of backing set whose elements are greater than or equal to fromElement . What surprised me a lot is that calling size on returned SortedSet is linear in time , that is O ( n ) . At least that is what I managed to dig up from the source code of OpenJDK : In TreeSet is implemented as wrapper over TreeMap , and within a TreeMap , there is EntrySetView class whose size method is as follows : This means that first time size is called is O ( n ) and then it 's cached as long as backing map is not modified . I was not able to find this fact in the API documentation . More efficient implementation would be O ( log n ) with memory tradeoff in caching of subtree sizes . Since such tradeoffs are being made for avoiding code duplication ( TreeSet as wrapper over TreeMap ) , I do n't see a reason why they should not be made for performance reasons.Disregarding me being right or wrong with my ( very brief ) analysis of the OpenJDK implementation of TreeSet , I would like to know is there a detailed and complete documentation on performance of many such operations especially ones which are completely unexpected ?"

"I have a Java application that is used to communicate with an embedded device over a UART connection ( RS422 ) . The host queries the microcontroller for data in 5 millisecond intervals . Up until recently I 've been using ScheduledExecutorService scheduleAtFixedRate to call my communication protocol method , but it turns out scheduleAtFixedRate is very unreliable for this desired level of precision ( as many other posts reveal ) . Among the data returned from the microcontroller is a timestamp ( in microseconds ) , allowing me to verify the interval between received data packets independently of the JVM . Needless to say , the interval when using scheduleAtFixedRate varied wildly - up to 30 milliseconds between packets . Additionally , the scheduler will then try to overcompensate for the missed cycles by calling the Runnable several times within one millisecond ( again , no surprise to anyone here ) . After some searching , there seemed to be a consensus that the JVM simply could not be trusted to ensure any kind of precise scheduling . However , I decided to do some experimenting on my own and came up with this : The result of this was fantastic . Adjacent timestamps never varied by more than 0.1 milliseconds from the expected 5 millisecond interval . Despite this , something about this technique does n't seem right , but I have n't been able to come up with anything else that works . My question is basically whether or not this approach is OK , and if not , what should I do instead ? ( I am running Windows 10 with JDK 8_74 )"

"Looking at the Java Virtual Machine Specification and compiled code tells us how `` synchronized '' blocks are implemented in java .

"I have often wondered this , is there a performance cost of splitting a string over multiple lines to increase readability when initially assigning a value to a string .

Or will it create 1 string then a new concatenating the value and then another one concatenating the values again ? This is for my own curiosity ."

"I need to find a suitable data structure for the following case . I have written a simple event dispatch system with events and listeners . The system is completely sequential , so no concurrency and synchronization issues whatsoever.Requirements and ThoughtsEach listener registers to a predefined ( compile time ) 1 or more types of events.Listeners can register and deregister during runtime.The order in which listeners register must be maintained since it is the order in which they receive events ( listeners are always added at the end , but can be removed from anywhere ) .An event type can have 0 or more listeners registered to receive it at any time.A visualization of this relationship can be explained as a table : The order of the rows is irrelevant.The order of the columns must be maintained.Columns can be added and removed.The number of rows is constant during runtime.My thoughts are : When dispatching an event , I need to know which listeners are registered to receive the event type . I 'm thinking about an Event - > Collection < Listener > mapping where the keys are unordered . The collection of listeners needs to maintain insertion order ( or not , if the following point can be used for this instead ) .I need to keep a collection of listeners that maintains insertion order regardless of the events they are registered to ( this demand comes from the objects the listeners are attached to ) . Because even if the Collection < Listener > above is insertion-ordered , it 's per event type and not global . I 'm thinking about an OrderedCollection < Listener > .When deregistering , I need to find all the event types a listener has registered to so it can be remove . I 'm thinking about a Listener - > Collection < Event > , unless the mapping in the first point can do a removeAll ( Listener ) operation on the lists in the value position , but this can leave empty lists instead of completely removing the key.It seems to me like a bidirectional multimap would fit this case . The backing multimaps are an UnorderedMap < Event , OrderedCollection < Listener > > and an OrderedMap < Listener , UnorderedCollection < Event > > . The OrderedCollection < Listener > might not need to be ordered if the ordering from the OrderedMap can be used . Obviously , any unordered data structure can be ordered , but it 's unnecessary.Alternatively , I 've seen ideas of a single multimap with a reverse/invert operation to get the opposite mapping . My concern is twofold : I do n't know if one side can have its keys ordered while the other doesn't.This seems like an expensive operation , and if i need to reverse the mapping all the time it can be inefficient.Pseudocode usageRegistering a listener : Dispatching an event : Deregistering a listener : Final Details and QuestionIf it matters , there are about 30 event types and the amount of concurrent registered listeners is O ( 10 ) , though over the lifetime of the program there could be O ( 100 ) listeners - most of them deregister and GC'd.A note about the ordering . Since the listeners have an incremental unique int id field , I might be able to ensure that ordering by id number is equivalent to ordering by registration ( insertion ) order . The discrepancy currently is that the id is set on initialization of the listener , while registration is done afterwards ( and another listener could be both created and registered in that gap ) . If there is an advantage to using sorted collections over ordered collections in this case , I can put in some work to guarantee that sorting by id is equivalent to insertion order.What data structure ( s ) would fit my needs ? Do I need to write my own ( I rather not reinvent the wheel ) or is there one ( s ) implemented already ( Guava , I 'm looking at you ) ?"

"Considering these classes and accumulation function , which represent a simplification of my original context ( yet reproducing the same problem ) : I have attempted to perform an accumulation of items ( originally data indexing reports ) by relying on a separate function , combined , which deals directly with elements of type Foo.It turns out that this code results in a compilation error ( OpenJDK `` 1.8.0_92 '' ) : `` Bad return type in lambda expression : Foo can not be converted to Bar '' . The compiler insists on attempting to reduce the stream using Bar as the accumulative element , even when there is Foo as a common type for both the arguments to the cumulative function and its return type.I also find peculiar that I can still take this approach as long as I explicitly map the stream into a stream of Foos : Is this a limitation of Java 8 's generic type inference , a small issue with this particular overload of Stream # reduce , or an intentional behaviour that is backed by the Java specification ?

"A fundamental part of the Java Object contract is that the hashCode ( ) method should be consistent with the equals ( ) method . This makes sense and is easy to understand : if two objects are `` equal '' in some way , they should return the same hash code . If not , you could put one object in a HashSet , for instance , and then later check to see if a separate instance is in the set and incorrectly get back false , even though the equals ( ) method would have considered the objects equivalent.In fact Java 's URI code has this problem as of Java 6 . Try this code : URI escape sequences , as per RFC 3968 , are case insensitive ; that is , % 2A and % 2a are considered equivalent . The Java URI.equals ( ) implementation takes this into account . However , the URI.hashCode ( ) implementation does not take this into account ! This means that two URI instances that return true for URI.equals ( ) nevertheless can return different hash codes , as illustrated in the code above ! I submitted this issue , which supposedly resulting in Java Bug 7134993 , but that bug is no longer available . The same issue , though , is shown in Java Bug 7054089 . ( I 'm not sure if this was from my submission or from someone else , but the issue is the same . ) However , the bug was denied with the evaluation , `` The examples cited are opaque URIs and so the scheme specific parts are not parsed . `` Whoever evaluated this bug must have not been familiar with what it means for equals ( ) and hashCode ( ) to be consistent . The contract for Object.equals ( ) clearly states , `` If two objects are equal according to the equals ( Object ) method , then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result . '' Note the use of `` must '' , not `` should '' .The point here is that , even though the evaluator claims that the URI is `` opaque '' and `` not parsed '' , the URI.equals ( ) implementation ( contrary to his/her claims ) is indeed parsing the URI and making allowances for case insensitivity . The URI.hashCode ( ) implementation is not.So am I being completely dense here and missing something obvious ? If I am , someone please enlighten me as to my mistake , and I 'll mark your answer as correct . Otherwise , the question is : now that Sun/Oracle no longer seems to allow comments on filed bugs , what recourse do I have to get recognition and action on this fundamental problem in the Java implementation of the primary identifier of the Internet , the URI ?"

"I am not sure if this is a definitive statement , but it seems to me that the Java API prefers constant ints over enums . From the parts of the API that I have used , I 've encountered many final static int constants where an enum could have been used instead . Once such example that I happen to be staring at this moment : From java.awt.BasicStroke : In fact , I do n't think I 've ever seen an enum used in a standard Java API class . Why is this ? I 'm designing an API for my own application ( about a billion times smaller than the Java API , but I 'm still trying to be smart about it ) , and trying to decide whether to use constant ints or enums . THIS post references a very popular book I have n't read yet which implies enums have many advantages . Most other highly scored answers in that same thread agree . So why does Java not seem to use its own enum capabilities ?"
How can I compare a Scala list with a Java list ? Is there some static helper method for comparison that accepts both Scala lists and Java lists ? Or is there a kind of `` lazy wrapper '' over both sorts of lists which I can then directly compare via == ?
I always seem to be needing to cast values in the params object in order to perform a .equals but it never feels right . If i use the parseXXX methods I also have to protect myself when the value is empty . It seems like there would be a better way to handle this in a dynamic language like Groovy . Has anyone found a different way that feels more like Groovy and less like Java ? I could build a utility class to clean this up but I am looking for some built in functionality so please do n't suggest additional libraries.Example :

"The current Apache Avro ( 1.8.2 ) documentation mentions a `` duration '' logical type : A duration logical type annotates Avro fixed type of size 12 , which stores three little-endian unsigned integers that represent durations at different granularities of time .

"Sending an e-mail via gmail resulted in getting a PKIX certification path error . The same applied to sending an e-mail from Tomcat . After solving the issue , I hope you find this post useful . This post provides you with a step by step diagnosis for these kinds of errors . Step 1 : I tried to solve the problem using this post and another post , but that did not help me . In most cases this will be sufficient . You can use the keytool to list the certificates via 'keytool -list -keystore `` % JAVA_HOME % /jre/lib/security/cacerts '' ' I added the certificate by clicking the lock-icon of the gmail URL and exporting/importing the certificate to the cacert file of my used JDK version . I could see with keytool -list that the certificate was added . This process is described well in the ( linked ) posts . Step 2A : Was I using the right truststore ? I added the JVM arguments to direct the certificate search , like -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore= '' ... ./jre/lib/security/cacerts '' -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword= '' changeit '' . Step 2B : When I change the value of the cacerts file to cacertsXYZ I get the error . So , this proofed that the 'cacert ' was used . Caused by : javax.mail.MessagingException : Ca n't send command to SMTP host ; nested exception is : javax.net.ssl.SSLException : java.lang.RuntimeException : Unexpected error : java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException : the trustAnchors parameter must be non-emptyStep 2C : Was this also the case for my Tomcat webserver ? I verified that in the cacerts of my JRE_HOME that the certificate was there . In Tomcat my JRE_HOME is `` C : \Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_144\jre '' . My JAVA_HOME = C : \Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_144 . Step 3 : I tried with publicly available 'SSLPoke ' Java class to see whether I could connect with Google and or smtp.gmail.com . The results are in the listing : I could connect with SSL to google.com AND mail.google.com via port 443 . Step 4 : The trusted store could be corrupt ? I installed a newer version of the JDK1.8 being v152 . I restarted the application without any success . Had this to do with the difference between JDK and JRE ? Only the JRE has a lib\security\cacerts file . I tried both the SSL ( 465 ) and TLS ( 587 ) ports . Nope . Step 5 : Running openssl ( with s_client -connect smtp.gmail.com:587 -starttls smtp ) showed that my virus scanner ( Avast ) was prohibiting the sending of secure mail . So , for a moment I disabled this email-shield . That gave the following error : java.lang.RuntimeException : javax.mail.AuthenticationFailedExceptionStep 6 : After releasing the virusscanner web shield , using the openssl gave the following error : CN = Google Internet Authority G3 verify error : num=20 : unable to get local issuer certificate . OpenSSL > s_client -connect smtp.gmail.com:587 -starttls smtp CONNECTED ( 00000280 ) depth=1 C = US , O = Google Trust Services , CN = Google Internet Authority G3 verify error : num=20 : unable to get local issuer certificate ... . Allowing the 'gmail account to be accessable from weakly authenticated apps ' , a setting in your google account , that finally yielded in correctly sending the e-mail . This is the link to the security settings of your Google account . Step 7 : Sending e-mail from another server may be a problem . Authentication errors are ( still ) the result . To overcome these errors , you can do : Check whether a two-step verification is turned OFF ( Google settings ) .Allow access to the Google account from https : //accounts.google.com/b/0/DisplayUnlockCaptchaNotice : The mkyong example is the base of my simple test application ."

"I may be misinterpreting the Jersey specification for the media type of a response when a method can produce one of several .

"It is usually admitted that extending implementations of an interface through inheritance is not best practice , and that composition ( eg . implementing the interface again from scratch ) is more maintenable . This works because the interface contract forces the user to implement all the desired functionality . However in java 8 , default methods provide some default behavior which can be `` manually '' overriden . Consider the following example : I want to design a user database , which must have the functionalities of a List . I choose , for efficiency purposes , to back it by an ArrayList . This would not usually be considered great practice , and one would prefer , if actually desiring the full capabilities of a List and following the usual `` composition over inheritance '' motto : However , if not paying attention , some methods , such as spliterator ( ) will not be required to be overridden , as they are default methods of the List interface . The catch is , that the spliterator ( ) method of List performs far worse than the spliterator ( ) method of ArrayList , which has been optimised for the particular structure of an ArrayList . This forces the developer to be aware that ArrayList has its own , more efficient implementation of spliterator ( ) , and manually override the spliterator ( ) method of his own implementation of List or lose a huge deal of performance by using the default method . So the question is : is it still `` as true '' that one should prefer composition over inheritance in such situations ?"

"I asked this at the libgdx forums but did n't get a response so I was hoping y'all could help me out : I have Actors that represent game pieces . What I 'm trying to do is make it so the player can click-and-drag the tile to move it around the screen and rotate it multiple times before submitting the placeTile command . From what I understand of DragAndDrop it does n't seem to be designed with my use case in mind so I figured I 'd instead attach a dragListener listener to each game piece ( code below ) . It works well for dragging , except I ca n't figure out how to set the 'minimum distance before drag starts ' to 0 ... but that 's not my main question ( though any insights would be appreciated ) Anyway , the big problem comes in when I rotate the actor , and then try to drag it : At 30 degrees rotation , drag acts almost like normal : at 60 degrees , very small movements of the mouse send the actor moving in a tight circle very quickly . Another 30 degrees , the tile actor exits the screen in 1-2 frames , moving in a wide arc . If the actor is rotated clockwise , it 's movements are clockwise ; same pattern for counter-clockwise.It looks like the translation of the actor is taking rotation into account ; I guess my question is , is it possible to rotate an Actor/Group without the rotation affecting future translations ? Alternatively , is there a better way to drag an Actor around the screen based on touch/mouse input ? I included some code below : I imagine I 'm screwing up something basic , but I ca n't figure out what : And for the listener that deals with rotation via scrolling mouse wheel : Any pointers ?

"Suppose I 've got this Scala trait : Providing a Java implementation is easy enough : Now let 's start with a generic trait : The approach above wo n't work , since the unit x returns is now boxed , but the workaround is easy enough : Now suppose I 've got an implementation with x defined on the Scala side : I know I ca n't see this x from Java , so I define my own : But that blows up : And if I try the abstract-class-that-delegates-to-super-trait trick : And then : It 's even worse : ( Note that this definition of JQux would work just fine if Baz did n't extend Foo [ Unit ] . ) If you look at what javap says about Qux , it 's just weird : I think the problems here with both Baz and Qux have to be scalac bugs , but is there a workaround ?

"I currently have a disagreement going on with my 2nd year JAVA professor that I 'm hoping y'all could help solve : The code we started with was this : And she wants us to remove the isEmpty ( ) reference and place its code directly into the if statement ( i.e . change the peek method contents to : if ( topIndex < 0 ) ... ... . ) to `` Make the code more efficient '' . I have argued that a ) the runtime/compile time optimizer would most likely have inlined the isEmpty ( ) call , b ) even if it did n't , the 5-10 machine operations would be negligible in nearly every situation , and c ) its just bad style because it makes the program less readable and less changeable.So , I guess my question is : Is there any runtime efficiency gained by inlineing logic as opposed to just calling a method ? I have tried simple profiling techniques ( aka long loop and a stopwatch ) but tests have been inconclusive . EDIT : Thank you everyone for the responses ! I appreciate you all taking the time . Also , I appreciate those of you who commented on the pragmatism of arguing with my professor and especially doing so without data . @ Mike Dunlavey I appreciate your insight as a former professor and your advice on the appropriate coding sequence . @ ya_pulser I especially appreciate the profiling advice and links you took the time to share ."

"In many places there are recommendations to call Realm.getDefaultInstance ( ) in onCreate method of the Activity and call close on Realm instance in onDestroy ( or in corresponding methods of presenter ) .However , for me it would be cleaner to use Java 's try-with-resources construct : Why cleaner ? IMO it is easier to manage that narrow scope of realm instance .

"I 'm running Ignite in a Kubernetes cluster with persistence enabled . Each machine has a Java Heap of 24GB with 20GB devoted to durable memory with a memory limit of 110GB . My relevant JVM options are -XX : +AlwaysPreTouch -XX : +UseG1GC -XX : +ScavengeBeforeFullGC . After running DataStreamers on every node for several hours , nodes on my cluster hit their k8s memory limit triggering an OOM kill . After running Java NMT , I was surprised to find a huge amount of space allocated to internal memory.Kubernetes metrics confirmed this : '' Ignite Cache '' is kernel page cache . The last panel `` Heap + Durable + Buffer '' is the sum of the ignite metrics HeapMemoryUsed + PhysicalMemorySize + CheckpointBufferSize.I knew this could n't be a result of data build-up because the DataStreamers are flushed after each file they read ( up to about 250MB max ) , and no node is reading more than 4 files at once . After ruling out other issues on my end , I tried setting -XX : MaxDirectMemorySize=10G , and invoking manual GC , but nothing seems to have an impact other than periodically shutting down all of my pods and restarting them.I 'm not sure where to go from here .

What I understand is that on the browser , with the javascript I currently have the cid gets randomly created and then stored in the _ga cookie . I also understand that I should share that clientid/cid value between client ( 'page view ' ) and server ( other events ) calls for the same client so that they are correlated together.This StackOverflow link was a helpful reference for me.Question is : should ICreate a clientid on the server and then share it with the client ; orShould I let the javascript on the client create the clientid and then try to share it with my server ? ( I suspect this is the better answer ) For ( 1 ) , what I was thinking I could do is : Store a UUID in the session on the server ( which is google app engine ) Directly use that UUID when I use Measurement Protocol to create events directly server-sideUse the same UUID when I create a ga object on a page using jsp : The thing that worries me about this approach is that the ID will only persist across the session on the server .

"I have an interface , Resource , which is supposed to wrap something and expose a few operations on the wrapped object.My first approach was to write the following , with the Strategy pattern in mind.The two implementations above differ in the locking scheme used ( regular locks , or read-write locks ) .There is also a ResourceManager , an entity responsible for managing these things.My idea of usage by the client , would be : This way , the client would know about resources , but would n't have to deal directly with resources ( hence the package-private classes ) . Also , I could make my own implementation of some common resources , like sockets , and the client would only ask for them ( ie , I would have to write a SocketStrategy implements ResourceStrategy < Socket > ) .To access resources , he would request an handler from the manager . This is due to each thread having some specific access privileges , and so the manager would create an handler with the appropriate access privileges.This is where the problem kicks in.This approach seems clean and clear to me , it also seems to be intuitive for the user.But , as hinted , the manager keeps a mapping from identifiers to resources . How would this be declared , and how would the manager retrieve the resources from the map ? Is this design acceptable , and/or following good practices ? Alternatively , I could wipe out the generics , and have ExclusiveResource and ShareableResource be abstract and public.These classes would then be extended , both by me and the client , for every type of resource needed ( FileResource extends ExclusiveResource , SocketResource extends ExclusiveResource , ... ) .This would probably eliminate the need for the strategy pattern , but would expose more of my package to the user.Which of these alternatives is the most correct , or widely accepted as good practice ? Edit : After some thought , I think I could be able to remove the generic from the Resource interface , since that 's the one causing trouble , and leave it on AbstractResource and its subclasses . The latter could still grant me compile-time verification of the strategies used.However , following the inheritance way seems to be more correct ."

"Java 8 has given us new methods with really long signatures like this : What I find odd about this is that wildcards have been used to ensure that the first two parameters are as general as possible , yet the third parameter is just a BinaryOperator < U > . If they 'd been consistent , surely it would be a BiFunction < ? super U , ? super U , ? extends U > ? . Am I missing something ? Is there a good reason for this , or did they just want to avoid making an already horrendous signature even worse ? EditI understand PECS , and I understand the principle that mergeFunction should be thought of as a way of taking two Us and getting back a U . However it would be useful to be able to have an object that could be reused in many different ways . For example : Obviously this is not a BinaryOperator < Double > , but it could be treated as one . It would be great if you could use MULTIPLY_DOUBLES as both a BiFunction < Number , Number , Double > and a BinaryOperator < Double > , depending on the context . In particular , you could simply pass MULTIPLY_DOUBLES to indicate that you want a load of doubles to be reduced using multiplication . However the signature for toMap ( and other new methods in Java 8 ) does not allow for this kind of flexibility ."

"I have questions about a couple techniques I 'm using in designing a class . I 've declared some of its members as public final instead of private , and the constructor calls overridable methods . I know that these are normally considered bad practice , but I think that they may be justified in my situation , and I want to know what others think.This is my class : I declared the member variables as public final because I plan on using them frequently and creating methods to control access to them would be tedious . For example , I plan on writing lines like this throughout the program : creature.stats.health.getCurrent ( ) ; creature.stats.health.resetMax ( ) ; Avoiding giving public access to stats and health would require writing methods like getCurrentHealth ( ) and resetMaxHealth ( ) throughout the Creature class . The CurMax class has 10 methods besides constructors , and the stats class has 12 members of types that are similar to CurMax , so that would require writing over 100 additional functions in the Creature class . In light of this , is the way I used public final members appropriate ? If it is n't , what would be another technique that would be more satisfactory ? If the use of public final members is fine , what about my use of overridable methods in the constructor ? I want to allow each subclass of Creature to determine its own algorithm for creating the stats and array of attacks . For example , one creature might pick some random attacks out of a list , while another chooses attacks that are effective against another specific creature . Since stats and attacks are final variables , though , they must be defined in Creature 's constructor . My workaround is to have the constructor call overridable methods to allow subclasses to determine the values of stats and attacks while leaving the actual assignment in the constructor.I understand that the main risk associated with using overridable methods in constructors is that the overriden methods will be called before the subclass has an opportunity to define its own data members . I think that this is avoided in my situation because the generateStats ( ) and generateAttacks ( ) methods are there only to be used in the constructor . Also , I added another abstract method , initMembers , that is called in the Creature constructor before anything else . Subclasses can define any member variables in this function before generateStats ( ) and generateAttacks ( ) are called.The constructors for Stats and Attack are large , so I ca n't simply pass a Stats object and an array of Attacks to the constructor . The call to super ( ) in the subclasses ' constructors would be unacceptably long.Is the way I 'm using overridable methods in the Creature constructor justified ? If it is n't , what else should I do ?"

"Recently I have been looking for ways to dynamically load jar files into my application at runtime . I have come along a certain solution several times , which is basically a `` hack '' that gets the system classloader and uses reflection to access the otherwisep rotected addURL method in order to add additional files to the original classpath at runtime . This solution supposendly works really well and avoids the problems that occur when writing and using a selfmade custom class loader.It looks something like this : My question is as follows : I assume there is a really good reason for making the addURL method protected in the first place , there must be some kind of pitfalls or dangers when adding files to the classpath dynamically . Besides assuming the system classloader is always a URLClassLoader , which `` should always be the case '' ( TM ) , what kind of trouble could I run into when using this `` hack '' ? Thanks"

"Consider the following two snippets of code on an array of length 2 : and I would assume that the performance of these two pieces should be similar after sufficient warm-up . I 've checked this using JMH micro-benchmarking framework as described e.g . here and here and observed that the second snippet is more than 10 % faster.Question : why has n't Java optimized my first snippet using the basic loop unrolling technique ? In particular , I 'd like to understand the following : I can easily produce a code that is optimal for cases of 2 filters and still can work in case of another number of filters ( imagine a simple builder ) : return ( filters.length ) == 2 ? new FilterChain2 ( filters ) : new FilterChain1 ( filters ) . Can JITC do the same and if not , why ? Can JITC detect that 'filters.length==2 ' is the most frequent case and produce the code that is optimal for this case after some warm-up ? This should be almost as optimal as the manually-unrolled version.Can JITC detect that a particular instance is used very frequently and then produce a code for this specific instance ( for which it knows that the number of filters is always 2 ) ? Update : got an answer that JITC works only on a class level . OK , got it.Ideally , I would like to receive an answer from someone with a deep understanding of how JITC works .

"I have a set of functions ( rules ) for validation which take a context as parameter and either return `` Okay '' or an `` Error '' with a message . Basically these could return a Maybe ( Haskell ) / Optional ( Java ) type.In the following I would like to validate properties of a Fruit ( the context ) and return an error message if the validation failed , otherwise `` Okay '' /Nothing.Note : I would prefer a solution that is purely functional style and stateless/immutable . It is a bit of a Kata , actually.For my experiments I used Kotlin , but the core problem also applies to any language that supports higher order functions ( such as Java and Haskell ) .You can find a link to the full source code here and the same at the very bottom.Given a Fruit class with color and weight , plus some example rules : Now I would like to chain the rule evaluation using a reference to the respective function , without specifying the context as an argument using a FruitRuleProcessor.When processing a rule fails , it should not evaluate any of the other rules.For Example : I do not care where it failed , only about the result . Also when a function returns an error , the others should not be processed.Again , this pretty much sounds like an Optional Monad.Now the problem is that somehow I have to carry the fruit context from check to check call.One solution I tried is to implement a Result class that takes a context as value and has two subclasses RuleError ( context : Fruit , message : String ) and Okay ( context ) . The difference to Optional is that now I can wrap around the Fruit context ( think T = Fruit ) I think that this looks like a monoid/Monad , with return in the constructor lifting a Fruit into a Result and or being the bind . Although I tried some Scala and Haskell , admittedly I am not so experienced with that.Now we can change the rules towhich allows to chain checks like intended : // Prints : Fruit not redToo heavyHowever this has one major drawback : The Fruit context now becomes part of the validation result , although it is not strictly necessary in there.So to wrap it up : I 'm looking for a wayto carry the fruit context when invoking the functions so that I can chain ( basically : compose ) multiple checks in a row using the the same methodalong with the results of the rule functions without changing the interface of these.without side-effectsWhat functional programming patterns could solve this problem ? Is it Monads as my gut feeling tries to tell me that ? I would prefer a solution that can be done in Kotlin or Java 8 ( for bonus points ) , but answers in other languages ( e.g . Scala or Haskell ) also could be helpful . ( It 's about the concept , not the language : ) ) You can find the full source code from this question in this fiddle ."

"Few listings from JCIP already appeared here . Here is one more ( orig . code ) : Comment in book : The condition predicate used by await is more complicated than simply testing isOpen . This is needed because if N threads are waiting at the gate at the time it is opened , they should all be allowed to proceed . But , if the gate is opened and closed in rapid succession , all threads might not be released if await examines only isOpen : by the time all the threads receive the notification , reacquire the lock , and emerge from wait , the gate may have closed again . So ThreadGate uses a somewhat more complicated condition predicate : every time the gate is closed , a `` generation '' counter is incremented , and a thread may pass await if the gate is open now or if the gate has opened since this thread arrived at the gate.Guys , you may laugh , but I ca n't get it : ) . Questions : explain usage of arrivalGeneration == generation to me in terms of thread T1 , T2 , ... and execution flow.why passage says every time the gate is closed , a generation counter is incremented ?

"This one puzzles me for 3 days . I have an application which needs to evaluate a certain set of integer polynomials ( of multiple args ) which have very few elements . I already have an implementation written in Java and I am currently porting to C++ . During testing , I noticed that the C++ version is orders of magnitudes slower that the Java variant . I know of course about JIT-ing and that this scenario is particulary well-posed for this kind of compilers , but what I see is way off from what I had expected . The sample code is below , you 'll need boost to compile the C++ code ( but that dependency is only required for simple time measurement ) . Apparently , the C++ version ( compiled with clang-3.3 ) runs slightly faster when it comes to pure computational power , but Java ( openjdk 1.7.0.60 ) does much better when the polynomial is interpreted . My guess so far is , that my C++ code is not quite optimal due to the iteration over small ( in the sample 1-element ) vectors . I assume the JVM does much better here when it comes to cache-hits misses . Is there any way to make my C++ version perform better ? Is there a different cause I just did not see ?

For example , you can see the load instructions reading the passed enum constant name and ordinal , as well as the this pointer , and passing them on to the superclass constructor , which requires them .

Now I would like to set one up using a context.xml file with Tomcat and IntelliJ , but I ca n't get this to work . How is this done ? A new project with a 4.0 Web Application framework can automatically create a web/WEB-INF directory with a web.xml file , but the web/META-INF directory containing a context.xml file is not created . If I do create web/META-INF/context.xml myself through the Tool Window > Project , and I use this to set up a connection pool as shown below , the file seems to be ignored.This is my guess as to what might be happening , though I 'm sure this is filled with errors : A WAR file is a packaged directory that is sent to Tomcat in an arrangement that Tomcat understands . web/WEB-INF/web.xml is a required file that is needed for a variety of reasons , one of which is to set up servlets . web/META-INF/context.xml is optional , and thus by default , IntelliJ does not create it . When a web/META-INF/context.xml is created manually , it must also be included into the WAR file otherwise IntelliJ will not send it to Tomcat.Even if the previous paragraph is true though , I still have not gotten Tomcat to use context.xml after trying to add it to the WAR .

"I know that calling overridable methods from constructors is a bad idea . But I also see that it 's being done everywhere with Swing , where code like add ( new JLabel ( `` Something '' ) ) ; occurs in constructors all the time.Take NetBeans IDE , for example . It is very picky about overridable calls in constructors . And yet , when it generates Swing code , it puts all those add ( ) method calls into an initializeComponents ( ) method ... which is then called from the constructor ! A nice way to hide a problem and disable the warning ( NetBeans does n't have a “ a private method that calls overridable methods is called from a constructor ” warning ) . But not really a way to solve the problem.What 's going on here ? I 've been doing it for ages , but always had an uneasy feeling about this . Is there a better way of initializing Swing containers , except for making an additional init ( ) method ( and not forgetting to call it every time , which is kind of boring ) ?

"As we know , some JIT allows reordering for object initialization , for example , can be decomposed into below steps : JIT compiler may reorder it as below : namely , step2 and step3 can be reordered by JIT compiler.Even though this is theoretically valid reordering , I was unable to reproduce it with Hotspot ( jdk1.7 ) under x86 platform.So , Is there any instruction reordering done by the Hotspot JIT comipler that can be reproduced ? Update : I did the test on my machine ( Linux x86_64 , JDK 1.8.0_40 , i5-3210M ) using below command : and I can see the tool reported something like : [ 1 ] 5 ACCEPTABLE The object is published , at least 1 field is visible.That meant an observer thread saw an uninitialized instance of MyObject .

"I am trying to implement my own LRU cache . Yes , I know that Java provides a LinkedHashMap for this purpose , but I am trying to implement it using basic data structures.From reading about this topic , I understand that I need a HashMap for O ( 1 ) lookup of a key and a linked list for management of the `` least recently used '' eviction policy . I found these references that all use a standard library hashmap but implement their own linked list : '' What data structures are commonly used for LRU caches and quicklylocating objects ? '' ( stackoverflow.com ) `` What is the best way to Implement a LRU Cache ? '' ( quora.com ) `` Implement a LRU Cache in C++ '' ( uml.edu ) '' LRU Cache ( Java ) '' ( programcreek.com ) The hash table is supposed to directly store a linked list Node as I show below . My cache should store Integer keys and String values.However , in Java the LinkedList collection does not expose its internal nodes , so I ca n't store them inside the HashMap . I could instead have the HashMap store indices into the LinkedList , but then getting to an item would require O ( N ) time . So I tried to store a ListIterator instead . So this leads to three problems : Problem 1 : I am getting a ConcurrentModificationException when I update the LinkedList using the iterator that I store in the HashMap.Problem 2 . How do I retrieve the value pointed to by the ListIterator ? It seems I can only retrieve the next ( ) value.Problem 3 . Is there any way to implement this LRU cache using the Java collections LinkedList , or do I really have to implement my own linked list ?"

Is some sort of adapter needed for this functionality ? To clarify , I have this at the moment : And I can invoke it via simple POST request.However , I would like for it to be invoked by consuming Data messages from some ( external ) Kafka topic.I was wondering if there is such a way to configure the descriptor in a fashion similar to this mockup : I 've ran into this discussion on Google Groups , but in the OPs questions , I do not see he is actually doing anything with EventMessages coming from some-topic except routing them to the topic defined by his service.EDIT # 1 : Progress updateLooking at the documentation , I decided to try the following approach.I added 2 more modules , aggregator-kafka-proxy-api and aggregator-kafka-proxy-impl.In new api module , I defined a new service , with no methods , but one topic which would represent my Kafka topic : In the impl module , I simply did the standard implementationNow , to actually consume these events , in my aggregator-impl module , I added a `` subscriber '' service , which takes these events , and invokes appropriate commands on entity.This effectively allowed me to publish a message on Kafka topic `` data-in '' , which was then proxied and converted to RecordData command before issued to the entity to consume.However , it seems somewhat hacky to me .

In that case , as described in the Service Clients section , you can create a third-party-service-api module in your Lagom project . That module will contain a Service Descriptor declaring the topic you will consume from .

This is the opposite of what I would normally expect , as usually performace goes up as the JIT kicks in.Of course , one would do several warm-up loops in any serious micro-benchmark , but I 'm curious as to what could be causing this behaviour , especially since if we know the loop can be performed in 24ms , it 's not very satisfying that the steady-state time is over 100ms.For reference the JDK I am using ( on linux ) : UPDATE : Here 's some update info , based on some of the comments , and some experimenting:1 ) moving the System.out I/O out of the loop ( by storing the timing in an array of size 'runs ' ) makes no significant difference on time.2 ) the output displayed above is when I run from within Eclipse . When I compile and run from the command line ( with the same JDK/JVM ) I get more modest , but still significant results ( 2x instead of 4x faster ) . This seems interesting , since usaully running in eclipse will slow things down , if anything.3 ) moving a up , out of the loop , so that it is reused each iteration has no effect.4 ) if int [ ] a is changed to long [ ] a , the first iteration runs even faster ( about 20 % ) , while the other iterations are still the same ( slower ) speed.UPDATE 2 : I think the answer by apangin explains it . I tried this with Sun 's 1.9 JVM and it 's going from : to : That 's quite the improvement !"

"I came across this code while watching a java game development series online.Video LinkI am still fairly new to java so please forgive me if it is obvious . It is explained in the video that gets rid of the alpha channel in the 0xAARRGGBB notation of the pixel to make it 0xRRGGBB . From what I understand , what the & 0xff does is capture the last byte of information off of an integer . It is also explained that the number 64 in is produced by dividing 255 by 4 ( I believe it was about limiting the amount of colors ) .so essentially my question is : how does 0xff get rid of the alpha channel ? I am fairly certain that my confusion is my lack of experience with numbers in hexadecimal form ."

"I am working on handprinted multi-digit recognition with Java , using OpenCV library for preprocessing and segmentation , and a Keras model trained on MNIST ( with an accuracy of 0.98 ) for recognition . The recognition seems to work quite well , apart from one thing . The network quite often fails to recognize the ones ( number `` one '' ) . I ca n't figure out if it happens due to preprocessing / incorrect implementation of the segmentation , or if a network trained on standard MNIST just has n't seen the number one which looks like my test cases.Here 's what the problematic digits look like after preprocessing and segmentation : becomes and is classified as 4. becomes and is classified as 7. becomes and is classified as 4 . And so on ... Is this something that could be fixed by improving the segmentation process ? Or rather by enhancing the training set ? Edit : Enhancing the training set ( data augmentation ) would definitely help , which I am already testing , the question of correct preprocessing still remains.My preprocessing consists of resizing , converting to grayscale , binarization , inversion , and dilation . Here 's the code : The preprocessed image is then segmented into individual digits as following :"
"I 'm really a new at Java concurrency and I 'm trying to implement the following specifications : We have a car park which has some park spotsEach car is represented as a thread which endlessy change the car state from Driving - Parking . Each car has his own parking spot.When the car is in the parking state , it tries to park in a spot ( no necessary his spot ) . If the spot is free then it parks else it will skip this parking phase and go back to drive.The car remains in the spot unless the owner of the spot want to park.This is not the exact specification , but the only problem that I have is the following : I 'm not able to make the car skip the turn . If two cars pick the same spots , then one is parked and the other is waiting until the park is free . Which is not the bahvior that I want.My first idea was to simply synchronize the read and write to a variable occupied : If I run this with three cars , then I will end up in having car0 is parking at spot1 , car1 is parking at spot0 , car2 is waiting on spot0 , because car1 is executing the synchronized block park ( Car c ) . I do n't get how is it possible that two cars can park in the same spot if the willingToPark is synchronized.Thank you"

"Is it necessary to use specialized concurrent versions of Java 's Collections data structures ( e.g .

"Problem 15 : Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid , there are 6 routes ( without backtracking ) to the bottom right corner.How many routes are there through a 20×20 grid ? So my attempt at Problem 15 is kinda bruteforcy because I try to get permutations of all of the possible valid paths by going from right to left and changing the predecessor of the first change of direction . For example , when I have a 2x2 grid ( look at the Problem 15 link graphics ) the first path I 'll take is right - right - down - down and the last one I 'll take is down - down - right - right , which is also my termination criteria . I add the possible valid paths into a list and also use that list to determine whether the valid path has been already added or not . And to permutate a path I 'll do what I 've mentioned earlier : I go from right to left in my array ( Which in the graphic would be the bottom right corner where the arrowhead points at ) and change the first element of which the next element is different from itself . So right - right - down - down would become right - right - right - down , which is obviously invalid since you have to have the same amount of rights and downs to be able to reach the end corner . So what I thought is to make another loop going from left to right and change as many elements as needed to get a valid path . So in this example right - right - right - down becomes down - right - right - down . Also , what I forgot is that I 'm not counting the points , I 'm counting the edges from top left corner to bottom right corner.So I have already written some code , but it does n't work at all.It somehow does n't change anything anywhere.and so on is all it 's outputting . It seems that the code simply does n't permutate my path , but also does n't get stuck in any of the for loops . My best guess would be that my function criteria are placed in the wrong sequenceI also thought of a solution with backtracking like we did for a labyrinth two years ago in school , but I want to see if this approach is anywhere viable or not before redoing everything.EDIT : I 'll try to implement the images of the 2 x 2 grid example asap , but the ProjectEuler website is under maintainance at the moment ."

"Java requires a thread to own the monitor of o before calling o.wait ( ) or o.notify ( ) . This is a well-known fact . However , are mutex locks fundamentally required for any such mechanism to work ? What if there was an API which providedandinstead , combining a CAS action with thread scheduling/descheduling ? This would have some advantages : threads about to enter the waiting state would not impede the progress of notifying threads ; they would also not have to wait on each other before being allowed to check the waiting condition ; on the notifying side any number of producer threads could proceed simultaneously.Is there a fundamental , insurmountable obstacle to providing such an API ?"

"This program compiles and runs in C++ but does n't in a number of different languages , like Java and C # .In Java this gives a compiler error like 'Void methods can not return a value ' .

Are there any other objections ? Edit : For future reference , I found some a similar question here return-void-type-in-c-and-cIn my humble opinion this question is n't answered yet . The reply 'Because it says so in the specification , move on ' does n't cut it , since someone had to write the specification in the first place .

"We have a very large GWT project that results in a monolithic app about 2Mb in size . The obvious way to break it up is to use split points . For example our app is menu driven so the logic behind each menu action could be a split point . Also , the code that invokes GWT RPC could also be a split point . In this way a 2Mb app could probably be broken down into a 300K startup app with the remainder loaded up on first use.GWT treats calls to GWT.runAsync ( ) as places where the JS can be broken up into smaller pieces which are loaded asynchronously at runtime . e.g . to set a split point where doSomething ( ) is invoked , we write it like this : GWT compiler will see this code and mark it as a candidate for splitting and break up the code into smaller fragments which will be loaded as they are first used.The problem we have is that if we put split points into the code , the build literally takes 10-50x longer to perform . I guess the code is not very efficient when dealing with a project containing a very large number of classes . So a 2 minute build becomes a 20-100 minute build which is unacceptable.So the question is , how can I put split points into the code but prevent the compiler from splitting unless I explicitly ask for it ? I envisage that day to day development will ignore the split points , but a nightly or production build would split.Any ideas ?"

"I 'm encountering a bizarre issue on a JBoss server where two classes are producing the same hashCode ( ) .Produces : I normally would n't care , but we 're using a framework that caches setters using a key that is comprised of hashcodes from the class and a property name .

A newer OGNL fixes the issue , but it wo n't be in Struts until 2.5 , currently in beta . ) What makes the issue somewhat bizarre to me isProblem appears after several days of usage ... and I 'm pretty sure both class/properties are getting cached during that time . This leads me to believe that the class instance hashcode is actually changing ... they became equal after several days.We 've observed the behavior in a very outdated Hotspot 1.6 , and now on 1.7.0_80 . Both are 32-bit builds on Sun SparcJVM reports -XX : hashCode as `` 0 '' I read that the RNG hashcode generator in Hotspot ( the `` 0 '' strategy ) can produce duplicates if there 's racing threads , but I ca n't imagine classloading triggering that behavior.Does Hotspot use special hashcode handling when creating a Class instance ?"

If the Alpha.foo parameter is changed to String instead of String ... , then the output is Beta : fooBeta : fooBeta : barBeta : barwhich makes sense.My understanding is that when you say Alpha a = new Beta ( ) ; , the compiler checks for Alpha.foo , but the JVM will actually run Beta.foo . For one thing , Beta does have a foo method whose signature matches the call . For another , I thought varargs methods only run when there 's no other method available that matches the call .

"I have been successfully using SimpleDateFormat for the last couple of years .

Since both classes ' time patterns are almost identical , this transition seemed a good idea at the time.I now have problems obtaining EpochMillis ( milliseconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z ) : While SDF would e.g . interpret 10:30 parsed using HH : mm as 1970-01-01T10:30:00Z , DTF does not do the same . DTF can use 10:30 to parse a LocalTime , but not a ZonedDateTime which is needed to obtain EpochMillis.I understand that the objects of java.time follow a different philosophy ; Date , Time , and Zoned objects are kept separately .

If I change calculation to make it more processor intensive by replacing method next with : both multithreaded versions start to execute more than twice as fast than the singlethreaded version on a 4 core machine.So clearly there must be some threshold that you can use to determine if it is worth to introduce multithreading and my question is : What is the basic rule that would help decide if a given calculation is intensive enough to be optimized by running it in parallel ( without spending effort to actually implement it ? )"

"When you employ a fluent approach you might have the following scenario : A strength of a fluent interface is that you can chain method invocations , but whilst Bar has inherited someMethod ( ) , the return type is Foo not Bar which would break the following chain : One answer could be to add @ Overrides for every inherited method , such that Bar has the additional method : But in large classes , and extended class hierarchies this can prove a mess of redundancy surely ? ! Is there an appropriate return type to give to fluent methods whereby every class that inherits it will return an object of its specific type ( so that we can chain methods without casts ) ?

"I 'm writing a program to implement an algorithm I found in the literature.In this algorithm , I need a while loop ; to check if the while condition is satisfied , I have created an Object ( of the same type as solution ) called copy . This copy is a copy of the solution before the solution is updated . So if there 's been a change in the solution , the condition in the while loop is satisfied.However , I am having some problems finding the best solution for the conditions of both objects as the while loop is executed , since I start with an empty solution ( resultset ) and the copy is also empty at that time ( both called with the constructor of the class ) . This means that when the while loop is executed , both objects are equal and thus all statements in the while loop are not executed.My solution for now is to create a dummy variable that is set to true before the while loop and is set to false in it . I doubt that this is the best solution , so I 'm wondering if there is a standard solution to this problem ( some way to force the program to always run the first iteration of the while loop ) ?

"I want to generate a list of numbers using lambda expressions and not a for-loop.So let 's say I want to generate a list of all triangular numbers under 100 . Triangular numbers are numbers which follow the formula : ( n*n+n ) /2What is the best way of doing this ? Currently I have this : But this seems unnecessarily overkill with the amount of calculations . I iterate n over 1 to 100 ( because lets assume I do not know what the max value for n is ) , then I map the triangle number function of that list and then I check which numbers are under 100 . Is there a more efficient way in doing this ? Also : can I generate the triangle numbers using only the iterate function of Stream instead of using iterate , limit and then map ? EDIT : So the main point here is : how can calculation of traingle numbers stop as soon as one of the triangle numbers exceeds 100 ? Usually I would write it like this : which stops as soon as a triangle number exceeds 100 , which is very efficient ; how can I retain this efficiency in lambda expression ?"
"I recenly encountered this problem in a project : There 's a chain of nested objects , e.g . : class A contains an instance variable of class B , which in turns has an instance variable of class C , ... , until we have a node in the tree of class Z.Each class provides getters and setters for its members . The parent A instance is created by an XML parser , and it is legal for any object in the chain to be null.Now imagine that at a certain point in the application , we have a reference to an A instance , and only if it contains a Z object , we must invoke a method on it . Using regular checks , we get this code : I know that exceptions should not be used for ordinary control flow , but instead of the previous code , I have seen some programmers doing this : The problem with this code is that it may be confuse when maintaining it , since it does n't show clearly which objects are allowed to be null . But on the other hand is much more concise and less `` telescopic '' .Is it an acceptable to do this to save development time ? How could the API be redesigned to avoid this problem ? The only thing I can think of to avoid the long null checking is to provide void instances of the nested objects and providing isValid methods for each one of them , but would n't this create a lot of innecesary objects in memory ?

"When setting a png image as the stage icon in JavaFX ( using Kotlin , but this is also a problem in Java ) , the icon seems to be deformed . I have googled for this problem , and found the following things : It was ( and probably still is ) a bug . On the issue page of this bug they explain that a workaround would be to avoid using semi-transparent pixels . I have tried this , but still my images get deformed , as is shown below . Left . Original 32x32 image provided to JavaFx . Right . The image JavaFx put in the taskbar . Left . Original 48x48 image provided to JavaFx . Right . The image JavaFx put in the taskbar.It looks like the 32x32 one has to be scaled up , and the 48x48 one has to be scaled down , to something around 42x42 ( I also made a 42x42 but that did n't help either ) . Since the sizes that Windows 'wants ' are either a power of two or 48x48 , you would say that those sizes would work.I came upon this older question about this topic . It is discussed here that JavaFX does not automatically pick the best size of the icon , but usually the last icon that you add to the icon set , so it is suggested to put the icon you think would be the best fit as last.As I am aware that this is ( probably ) an unresolved bug in JavaFX and the other question was last active about three years ago , I am wondering if anyone has found a better workaround in the meantime . I have created an MWE in Kotlin similar to the one provided in the issue page , as you can easily compare the original image to the one that ends up in the task bar .

"Our legacy app is stuck with a terrible framework ( okay , I 'll name names , it 's Tapestry 4 ) that involves a ridiculous number of EventListeners ( ~100,000 ) for the simplest operations . I 'm guessing this is beyond what javax.swing.event.EventListenerList was ever meant to handle , and in this unfortunate use case it 's causing us some nasty performance headaches.I spent a couple of hours whipping up the fairly naive HashMap/ArrayList-based replacement below , and it 's massively faster in almost every way : Add 50,000 listeners : EventListenerList > 2 secondsEventListenerMap ~ 3.5 millisecondsFire event to 50,000 listeners : EventListenerList 0.3-0.5 millisecondsEventListenerMap 0.4-0.5 millisecondsRemove 50,000 listeners ( one at a time ) : EventListenerList > 2 secondsEventListenerMap ~280 millisecondsFiring might be just a hair slower , but modification is enormously faster . Admittedly , the situation this framework has put us in is pathological , but it still seems like EventListenerList could have been replaced a long time ago . Obviously there are issues with the public API ( e.g. , it exposes its raw internal state array ) , but there must be more to it than that . Maybe there 's multithreaded cases where EventListenerList is much safer or more performant ?"
"My setup is as follows : inside my onCreate I initialize an ArrayList as follows : and the AsyncTask fetches text via HttpURLConnection ( ) , parses the json using JsonReader , and adds each line of text to the textList ( all of this happens inside the AsyncTask 's doInBackground .

All of this works fine in all other supported Android versions but when I tried it in a Marshmallow emulator gotoNextSection ( ) results in an IndexOutOfBoundsException . This occurs after the new content is added to the freshly cleared arrayList ( verified via logging ) , so I do n't think it 's a race condition . Note that not clearing the list prevents the exception , and since this is the only ArrayList used in the Activity I 'm positive that .clear ( ) is the problem . I 've tried nulling and reinitializing it before launching the AsyncTask as an alternative as well , to no avail . Again , this happens exclusively on Android 6.0 . Thoughts ? EDIT : Here 's the logcat stacktrace .

"I started to learn jigsaw java-9 feature and read some articles/video.I ca n't understand concept of optional dependencies ( requires static ) quote from article : When a module needs to be compiled against types from another module but does not want to depend on it at run time , it can use a requires static clause . If foo requires static bar , the module system behaves different at compile and run time : At compile time , bar must be present or there will be an error . During compilation bar is readable by foo . At run time , bar might be absent and that will cause neither error nor warning . If it is present , it is readable by foo.So I want to know couple of things : What the reason to make module dependable on another module during compile time but not in runtime ? any examples ? instruments like lombok ? Any analogs of optional dependencies in java prior java-9 ? P.S.I found one more explanation : quote from article : Sometimes we write code that references another module , but that users of our library will never want to use . For instance , we might write a utility function that pretty-prints our internal state when another logging module is present . But , not every consumer of our library will want this functionality , and they don ’ t want to include an extra logging library . In these cases , we want to use an optional dependency .

"Since I use streams a great deal , some of them dealing with a large amount of data , I thought it would be a good idea to pre-allocate my collection-based collectors with an approximate size to prevent expensive reallocation as the collection grows . So I came up with this , and similar ones for other collection types : Used like thisMy concern is that the implementation of Collectors.toSet ( ) sets a Characteristics enum that Collectors.toCollection ( ) does not : Characteristics.UNORDERED . There is no convenient variation of Collectors.toCollection ( ) to set the desired characteristics beyond the default , and I ca n't copy the implementation of Collectors.toSet ( ) because of visibility issues . So , to set the UNORDERED characteristic I 'm forced to do something like this : So here are my questions : 1 . Is this my only option for creating an unordered collector for something as simple as a custom toSet ( ) 2 . If I want this to work ideally , is it necessary to apply the unordered characteristic ?

So it all makes sense , but I do not understand what software component combines the two characters to one umlaut , and where this behavior is specified.It has nothing to do with the fact that powerful character code tables use several bytes as internal representation .

"I have this abstract class where I have defined some methods that implement database actions ( fetch rows , insert , delete , etc . ) Now I want to make method that will return some rows ( i.e . the whole table ) but instead of the domain classes I want it to return the corresponding model classes ( which basically is the same as domain but without the relationship lists and some other stuff I do n't need for the presentation layer ) .The abstract class isand I want to add another method that will call fetchAll ( ) and then iterate each item and create the model equivalent and return that list.Disregarding that this is the code I though just now writing the question , is it acceptable to add a parameter for a generic that is not defined in the class . IMO a class can have methods returning other data types so it should not be a problem . In my case I pass the class so I can create an instance of the model and then use the domain to fill the members . I was of two opinions , The one I wrote where I add a method to the model class to create it self from the domain object . I was thinking of a constructor that takes the domain object as an argument , but I think it 's a bit of a hassle to call a constructor using generics ( It would need reflection utilities at the very least ) so I though of a method to fill the details after creating an instance using the default constructor . Also the model is on a higher layer and I think higher layers should use lower ones ( Database- > Domain classes- > Access classes ( DAO ) - > Service classes- > Servlet classes -- -- > JSP showing data ) I could add a method to the domain class that transforms the domain to its model and call that without having to pass the class of the modelbut I feel that the domain class should be as clean a representation of the table in the database with the only methods having to do with the columns.Would it better to add the parameter on the class . I am only going to use it for this method ... Any thoughts comments always welcome"

"I 'm using the stream spliterator directly for the low-level operations in the library I 'm writing . Recently I discovered very weird behavior when I take the stream spliterator and interleave tryAdvance/trySplit calls . Here 's a simple code which demonstrates the problem : The output isAs you can see , after flat-mapping I should get the ordered stream of consecutive numbers from 1 to 9 . I split the spliterator once , so it should jump to some intermediate location . Next I consume an element from it and split it one more time . After that I print all the remaining elements . I expect that I will have several consecutive elements from the stream tail ( probably zero elements , it would also be fine ) . However what I get is 5 and 6 , then sudden jump to 9.I know that currently in JDK spliterators are not used this way : they always split before the traversal . However official documentation does not explicitly forbid to call the trySplit after tryAdvance.The problem was never observed when I use spliterator created directly from collection , array , generated source , etc . It 's observed only if the spliterator was created from the parallel stream which had the intermediate flatMap.So the question is : did I hit the bug or it 's explicitly forbidden somewhere to use the spliterator in this way ?"

"I have a Spring Boot java app that uses a self-signed certificate to communicate with the android front-end.I use a tomcat server as my container for the app : Now , I have enabled https / ssl : I have to enable SSL as I want my android frontend to communicate to my server securely . I use the technique called certificate pinning which means I add the same self-signed certificate to both my server and my android app . For any http communications between the two , the communication will be encrypted with the keys of the same certificate and hence the server and android app will be able to understand one another.When I load it into Heroku , I get errors each time I try to call the server : According to this blog by Julie : http : //juliekrueger.com/blog/ As a side note , Heroku apps are https enabled by default . The server I was installing had Tomcat configured to use https , and trying to access an endpoint was returning a code=H13 desc= '' Connection closed without response '' error . After I removed that configuration the error went away.I can fix the error by just removing the ssl / https from my tomcat server , but as I mentioned , I want to use the certificate pinning technique for secure communications.I was thinking whether it was possible to disable the SSL on heroku side but keep my tomcat server SSL active but I already contacted Heroku and they told me that disabling the piggyback SSL that comes standard with their service is not possible.I also looked at the paid alternative here called SSL Endpoint but it seems only userful for custom domains . Since all endpoints are coded within my android app and is not visible to the user , it makes no sense for me to use a custom domain . Furthermore , I do n't think it will solve my problem as its sole objective seems to be to create the custom domain : SSL Endpoint is only useful for custom domains . All default appname.herokuapp.com domains are already SSL-enabled and can be accessed by using https , for example , https : //appname.herokuapp.com.I googled for a few days now and can not seem to come up with a solution . Disabling ssl on my tomcat side would not be acceptable in my mind as it poses too much risks . I would even consider other services ( Azure etc ) if this would solve my problem.Any ideas on how I can solve this ?"

Two requirements exist : no one should be able to see the intermediate results of the operation ( i.e . one acount sum is increased , but others is not yet decreased ) reading access should not be blocked during the operation ( i.e . old values of account sums should be shown during the operation goes on ) Can you suggest some ideas on this ? 1 ) Assume 2 threads modify some class field via synchronized method or utilizing an explicit lock . Regardless of synchronization , there are no guarantee that this field will be visible to threads , that read it via NOT synchronized method . - is it correct ? 2 ) How long a thread that is awoken by notify method can wait for a lock ? Assume we have a code like this : Can we state that at least one thread will succeed and grab the lock ? Can a signal be lost due to some timeout ? 3 ) A quotation from Java Concurrency Book : '' Single-threaded executors also provide sufficient internal synchronization to guarantee that any memory writes made by tasks are visible to subsequent tasks ; this means that objects can be safely confined to the `` task thread '' even though that thread may be replaced with another from time to time . `` Does this mean that the only thread-safety issue that remains for a code being executed in single-threaded executor is data race and we can abandon the volatile variables and overlook all visibility issues ? It looks like a universal way to solve a great part of concurrency issues . 4 ) All standard getters and setters are atomic . They need not to be synchronized if the field is marked as volatile . - is it correct ? 5 ) The initiation of static fields and static blocks is accomplished by one thread and thus need not to be synchronized . - is it correct ? 6 ) Why a thread needs to notify others if it leaves the lock with wait ( ) method , but does not need to do this if it leaves the lock by exiting the synchronized block ?"
I decompiled some Java code the other day and found this : Obviously using '== ' to test for string equality is badBut I wondered - This code has been compiled and decompiled . If all the strings have been defined at compile time and interned and the code has been compiled - is it possible that s1.equals ( s2 ) could have been optimized down to 's1 == s2 ' ?

"I 've been having some problems using the JSlider class - specifically with tick labels.The first time I use setMajorTickSpacing and setMinorTickSpacing everything works as expected . However , subsequent calls to setMajorTickSpacing update the ticks , but not the labels . I 've written a simple example to demonstrate this behaviour : Two simple work-arounds seem to fix the problem - either using slider.setLabelTable ( null ) or slider.setLabelTable ( slider.createStandardLabels ( 25 ) ) before the second call to setMajorTickSpacing . Given this , it would seem that the label table is not being updated correctly.I 'm not sure if this is the intended behaviour or not . My first instinct is that updating the tick spacing should also update the labels , but there are also arguments for separating the two.So I 'd like to know which it is - is this a bug in JSlider or the intended behaviour ? If it is the intended behaviour , what would be the standout reasons for making that choice ?"

I have two pieces of code that are identical in C # and Java . But the Java one goes twice as fast . I want to know why . Both work with the same principal of using a big lookup table for performance.Why is the Java going 50 % faster than C # ? Java code : It just enumerates through all possible 7 card combinations . The C # version is identical except at the end it uses Console.writeLine.The lookuptable is defined as : Its size in memory is about 120 Megabytes.The C # version has the same test code . It 's measured with Stopwatch instead of nanoTime ( ) and uses Console.WriteLine instead of System.out.println ( `` '' ) but it takes at least double the time.Java takes about 400ms . For compilation in java I use the -server flag . In C # the build is set to release without debug or trace defines.What is responsible for the speed difference ?

"I have been trying to implement basic text bubbles for a small game I am developing . Not wanting to go too fancy , I started with a basic rounded rectangle with a border containing some text : Then , I decided that text bubbles should fade out after a preset time . And this is where I stumbled upon a problem : when I tried to display the bubbles in a test window , everything worked fine , but when I displayed them in game , there was a distortion when the bubble faded out . I tested some more , debugged , and found the only difference between the two cases was that on the test window I drew the bubble with the paintComponent method 's Graphics , while in game I used BufferedImages to simulate layers and used the graphics from image.createGraphics . I could then successfully replicate the bug : Here , you see that when the bubble on the left is fading , its rounded corners change shape compared to before fading , whereas the bubble on the right 's rounded corners do not change . Indeed , the left bubble is drawn on a BufferedImage which is then drawn on the panel , whereas the right bubble is directly drawn on the panel.I have isolated the code which is needed to reproduce the problem : Here is the result the above code produces : Anyways , this shows that drawing to the BufferedImage is what causes the problem , however it is not an option to let go of BufferedImages at the moment.I tried to debug the code to see what could cause this difference and only could notice that the graphics object uses different components to draw when transparency was involved , however that does n't help me in solving my problem as , even if it was possible to force the graphics to do what I want them to , I 'd rather avoid hacking if possible.Does anyone know of a relatively simple and efficient way to solve this problem , or work around it ? Anyways , thanks for taking the time to read this : ) PS : As this is the first time I ask a question , I may have missed some stuff , so feel free to tell me if that is the case !

"I 'm learning test-driven development , and I have noticed that it forces loosely coupled objects , which is basically a good thing . However , this also sometimes forces me to provide accessors for properties I would n't need normally , and I think most people on SO agree that accessors are usually a sign of bad design . Is this inevitable when doing TDD ? Here is an example , the simplified drawing code of an entity without TDD : The entity knows how to draw itself , that 's good . All in one place . However , I 'm doing TDD , so I want to check whether my entity was moved correctly by the `` fall ( ) '' method I am about to implement . Here is what the test case could look like : I have to look at the object 's internal ( well , at least logically ) state and see if the position was updated correctly . Since it 's actually in the way ( I do n't want my test cases to depend on my graphics library ) , I moved the drawing code to a class `` Renderer '' : Loosely coupled , good . I can even replace the renderer with one that displays the entity in a completely different way . However , I had to expose the internal state of the entity , namely the accessors for all of its properties , so that the renderer could read it.I feel that this was specifically forced by TDD . What can I do about this ? Is my design acceptable ? Does Java need the `` friend '' keyword from C++ ? Update : Thanks for your valuable inputs so far ! However , I fear I have chosen a bad example for illustrating my issue . This was completely made up , I will now demonstrate one that is closer to my actual code : This is a game loop based implementation of a game where an entity can fall down , among other things . If it hits the ground , a new entity is created.The `` mockRenderer '' is a mock implementation of an interface `` Renderer '' . This design was partly forced by TDD , but also because of the fact that I 'm going to write the user interface in GWT , and there is no explicit drawing in the browser ( yet ) , so I do n't think it is possible for the Entity class to assume that responsibility . Furthermore , I would like to keep the possibility of porting the game to native Java/Swing in the future.Update 2 : Thinking about this some more , maybe it 's okay how it is . Maybe it 's okay that the entity and the drawing is separated and that the entity tells other objects enough about itself to be drawn . I mean , how else could I achieve this separation ? And I do n't really see how to live without it . Even great object-oriented programmers use objects with getters/setters sometimes , especially for something like an entity object . Maybe getter/setter are not all evil . What do you think ?"

I 'm looking at the explanation of the visitor pattern here which shows the following code : From the standpoint of JavaScript developer the accept method seems redundant since the code could be written like this : Am I right to assume that this wo n't work because the compiler does n't know which overloaded visit method of the visitor to execute ?

"Alright , this is a sort of dual-purpose question . The main thing I hope to take away from this is more knowledge of multithreading . I am a complete newbie when it comes to multithreading , and this is my first actual attempt to do anything in multiple threads . The other thing I hope to take away is some help with a piece of homework that I am turning into a much more complicated franken-project for fun and learning . In the first part of this question I am going to detail my thinking and methodology for the threads I have been working on in my homework assignment . If I am doing anything that is bad practice , needs to be fixed , whatever , please let me know so I can learn . Again , I know practically nothing about multithreading.First off , I am currently taking a computer science course which , to be nice about it , has homework which uses techniques and data structures that I 've already learned and is thus not challenging . To attempt to not be entirely bored out of my skull , I am trying to take a simple project ( creating a Linked List and a sorted Linked List ) and turn it into a multi-threaded franken-program . I would like the method for adding new elements to be in a separate thread and gets input from a queue ( not entirely necessary for an un-ordered list , but will be more useful for proper ordering ) , and for the ordered list I want a separate thread that will patrol the list to make sure all elements are in order ( one of the methods that I am NOT ALLOWED to change returns references to entire nodes , which have completely public data ) . Those are the two main things I would want to create , but definitely not the only things I might want to try and figure out . This is meant to be pretty much just a test to learn about multithreading , so I 'm not particularly designing this project for practicality . If you want to leave a comment about what is good programming practice for what should be threaded or not , it would be highly appreciated.As a step I took just recently , the idea for which was gleaned from reading a post on StackOverflow itself , I have created a master class which has Threads passed to it so it can stop them and clean everything up at the end of the program . This is done through use someThread.interrupt ( ) and having the Thread 's run ( ) method checking for that exception . However , I have found a problem with this method : the loop that runs through the Threads and calling interrupt ( ) , most times , does not actually run . Here is the code for the method : While attempting to debug it , I put in the while loop to try and force the method to eventually run the for loop , but all that happens is it outputs `` Stopping all threads '' and then I never see anything else . I do n't know if this is a bad way to code , or what is wrong with this code . Any help figuring out how to make this work is appreciated ( if you need to see more of the class , please let me know . I do n't really know what you need to see , but I do n't want to copy and paste several entire java files ) .On top of this problem , I have also determined that when running my program , it will reach the last line and attempt to stop all Threads before the Thread going through the queue of numbers to add to the list is finished adding everything . This is also a problem when attempting to output the list through a toString method directly after adding numbers to the queue , as nothing will yet be added , and thus nothing will be output to the console . Here is my main method that shows the order of things happening ( though I imagine that it is less important when dealing with threading ) : Lastly , here is the custom thread that I have made which is supposed to check the queue for elements , then add all elements in the queue to my actual list : Now , the absolute last thing I would like to ask for are some of the basic primers and guidelines and such for good multithreading . I have found a good amount of tutorials , but there are some things that people do n't mention in tutorials , as well as most tutorials are only so-so . If you know of any good tutorials , I would appreciate links to them . If there are any good coding methodologies for multithreading , that would be very appreciated as well . Just any sort of information that you think might help me wrap my brain around this concept , as well as make sure that when implementing it , I do it in a way that is less prone to bugs and people wo n't yell at me for bad practices.EDIT : To answer the questions matt b put into a comment , addThread is purely a reference to the Thread that looks at the queue which has elements in it to add to the list and puts them into the list . It is a private Thread inside of the class containing the AddThread class ( clever use of names , eh ? ) . Threads are constructed in a way that was posted in another question at StackOverflow . Here is an example ( and also a snippet of code showing what addThread is ) : All Threads are created in a similar way . As to what the Thread I posted is supposed to be doing , I did explain that in detail above , but I 'll try to put a synopsis here . The AddThread class is an inner class which gets created at time of construction of the linked list class I am trying to make . It looks at a private queue which may or may not have elements in it , and when it does , it puts those elements into the linked list . The queue gets added too when the linked list 's add ( T newElt ) method is called.EDIT EDIT : In the interest of full disclosure , and for those who wish to take the time , I am going to post the entirety of the two relevant java files here.List.javaActiveThreads.java"
"Here is a snippet of the code-This gives me -error : type mismatch ; found : java.lang.String ( `` foo '' ) required : Nothing queue.add ( `` foo '' ) My understanding is its because of me not specifying the type of the elements going into the queue .

"I 'm reading about type inference for generics , and this code was provided as an example that fails to compile.And the explanation given in the book was : `` ( It looks like the setError ( ) method in StrLastError is overriding setError ( ) in the LastError class . However , it is not the case . At the time of compilation , the knowledge of type S is not available . Therefore , the compiler records the signatures of these two methods as setError ( String ) in superclass and setError ( S_extends_CharSequence ) in subclass—treating them as overloaded methods ( not overridden ) . In this case , when the call to setError ( ) is found , the compiler finds both the overloaded methods matching , resulting in the ambiguous method call error . `` I really do n't understand why type S ca n't be inferred at compile time.String is passed when invoking the constructor of class StrLastError , and from the API docs , String does implement interface CharSequence , so does n't that mean that S for < S extends CharSequence > actually is of type String ? I 've read the Java online tutorial on the topic of generics several times . I 've checked `` Type Inference '' , and Inheritance , I just do n't know how the whole thing works . I really need an explanation on this question.The points I 'm stuck at are : If the subtype ca n't decide S , how come the super type can decide T , because the superclass does not have an upper bound ? Or does it infer that T is String because the subtype calls the supertype 's constructor first ? I understand that if the Constructor is invoked as : there will be no ambiguity , since it 's plain method overriding then . ( Or am I even wrong here ? ) However , like I said in the beginning , if String is passed , why ca n't S be inferred to be String ?"

I would rather say `` Hey , based on X I want you to instantiate this class for me '' I have considered a couple of options.Change the provides method to take in all of the possible implementations : This allows Dagger to instantiate them and satisfy all of their dependencies but it 's not a good idea if each of the implementations is relatively large or expensive to create.Change the provides method to take in a collection of all of the dependencies for the different implementations.This is slightly better than option 1 in that Dagger does n't have to instantiate every single implementation , however it still needs to instantiate all of the dependencies even though they might not be used in all cases . I 'm also back to creating the objects myself even though they could be created by Dagger.Create one module per implementation and instantiate the appropriate module . So something like : This would be fine , but now I have issues defining the component that depends on the module.What 's the best way to tackle this problem ? One suggestion has been to try option 1 with the parameters wrapped in Lazy . Then I only end up calling .get ( ) on one . I 'll try this out when I can and post the results"
"I am writing a Kotlin library .

"Background : I 'm using jOOQ to access a Firebird Database . Firebird 2.x has a row size limit of 64KB . I never hit the limit before , but this particular database uses UTF8 which means the limit shrunk to around 16K characters . This is how I 'm using jOOQ : Load or Create a POJO ( generated ) as needed . e.g . : Use the book object as needed.Store it back as a record if user saves changes.Step 3 fails on the executeUpdate ( ) method because somehow jOOQ is casting all the empty VARCHAR fields to VARCHAR ( 4000 ) . The error message is `` SQL error code = -204 . Implementation limit exceeded . block size exceeds implementation restriction '' .This is a known Firebird limitation and nothing can be done about it unfortunately . In the table I have around 8 empty VARCHAR ( 512 ) fields , which is supposed to be around 8x4x512 ( or 16KB ) max in UTF8 , but since jOOQ 's interpreting it as VARCHAR ( 4000 ) , that 's 8x4x4000 ( 128KB ) which is obviously over the limit . If I set the NULL or empty fields to some random string , then jOOQ will cast it to the exact string length . ( `` ABC '' will get cast to varchar ( 3 ) ) So my question is : How do I get executeUpdate ( ) to work without jOOQ casting my null fields to VARCHAR ( 4000 ) ?"

"I found the article `` Avoiding memory leaks '' , where it is said that the following code : is not a good idea , since : When the screen orientation changes the system will , by default , destroy the current activity and create a new one while preserving its state . In doing so , Android will reload the application 's UI from the resources.So the above code : ... leaks the first activity created upon the first screen orientation change . When a Drawable is attached to a view , the view is set as a callback on the drawable . In the code snippet above , this means the drawable has a reference to the TextView which itself has a reference to the activity ( the Context ) which in turns has references to pretty much anything ( depending on your code . ) But , when screen orientation changes , the method setBackgroundDrawable ( Drawable background ) is called , which in turn calls : The method Drawable.setCallback ( ) is definied in the following way : So , now background should release the old reference to the previous TextView , and a new reference to the new TextView should be created . So , it seems like changing screen orientation leaks a reference only until the activity is newly created . Where am I going wrong ?"

"My concern is that cryptographic keys and secrets that are managed by the garbage collector may be copied and moved around in memory without zeroization.As a possible solution , is it enough to : EDIT : Please note that my issue is regarding not only zeroization of the official ( referenced ) copy of the object , but also any stale copies the garbage collector may have made while it shuffles memory around for space and speed efficiency.The simplest example is the mark-and-sweep GC , where objects are marked as 'referenced ' and then all those objects are copied to another region . The rest are then garbage and so they are collected . When the copy happens , that might leave residual key data that is n't being managed anymore by the garbage collector ( because the 'official ' data is in the new region ) .A litmus test for this would be if you use a key in the crypto module , zeroize the key , then inspect the entire JVM process space , you should not find that key ."

Is local integration testing really feasible in this day and age with more and more services becoming bound to the cloud .

"I 'm writing some `` big data '' software that needs to hold a lot of data in memory . I wrote a prototype in c++ that works great .

If I create , e.g. , 10m of these objects and use Runtime.totalMemory ( ) - Runtime.freeMemory ( ) before and after and then divide as appropriate I get approximately 36 bytes per structure . A ~2.4x memory difference is pretty nasty ; its gon na get ugly when we try to hold hundreds of millions of DataPoints in memory.I read somewhere that in cases like this in Java its better to store the data as arrays -- essentially a column-based store rather than a row-based store . I think I understand this : the column-based way reduces the number of number of references , and perhaps the JVM can even pack the ints into 8-byte words intelligently . What other tricks can I use for reducing the memory-footprint of what is essentially a memory block that has one very large dimension ( millions/billions of datapoints ) and one very small dimension ( the O ( 1 ) number of columns/variables ) ? Turns out storing the data as 4 int arrays used exactly 16 bytes per entry . The lesson : small objects have nasty proportional overhead in java ."

However , when I run checkstyle through mvn checkstyle : checkstyle in order to get the XML report much more efficiently , the checkstyle plugin fails back to use the default configuration . When I move the plugin to < build > the XML is generated properly , but now the checkstyle report is not included in the generated site anymore.What is the ( current ) way of setting up report plugins as Checkstyle , while perserving the ability to run the plugin separately under the same configuration ? Is it really the preferred way to defined your plugins and configuration twice ?"

"The code below calls two simple functions 10 billion times each . My assumption was that the performance of these two calls would be close to identical . If anything I would have guessed that passing two arguments would be slightly slower than passing one . Given all arguments are object references I was n't expecting the fact that one was a list to make any difference.I have run the test many times and a typical result is `` 12781/30536 '' . In other words , the call using two strings takes 13 secs and the call using a list takes 30 secs . What is the explanation for this difference in performance ? Or is this an unfair test ? I have tried switching the two calls ( in case it was due to startup effects ) but the results are the same . UpdateThis is not a fair test for many reasons . However it does demonstrate real behaviour of the Java compiler . Note the following two additions to demonstrate this : Adding expressions s1.getClass ( ) and sl.getClass ( ) to the functions makes the two function calls perfom the sameRunning the test with -XX : -TieredCompilation also makes the two functions calls perform the sameThe explanation for this behaviour is in the accepted answer below . The very brief summary of @ apangin 's answer is that func2 is not inlined by the hotspot compiler because the class of its argument ( i.e . List ) is not resolved . Forcing resolution of the class ( e.g . using getClass ) causes it to be inlined which significantly improves its performance . As pointed out in the answer , unresolved classes are unlikely to occur in real code which makes this code a unrealistic edge case ."
"I was reading an essay , which actually talks about double-checked locking , but I 'm surprised about an even more basic failure in the code presented as examples . It is stated there that it is possible that the initialization of an instances ( i.e . writes to the instance variables that happen before the constructor returns ) may be reordered to after a reference to the instance is written to a shared variable ( a static field in the following example ) .Is it true that with the following definition of class Foo , with one thread executing Foo.initFoo ( ) ; and a different thread executing System.out.println ( Foo.foo.a ) ; , the second thread may print 0 ( instead of 1 or throwing a NullPointerException ) ? From what I know about the Java memory model ( and memory models in other languages ) it actually does n't surprise me that this is possible but intuition is voting very strongly for it being impossible ( maybe because object initialization is involved and object initialization seems so sacred in Java ) .Is it possible to `` fix '' this code ( i.e . that it will never print 0 ) without synchronization in the first thread ?"

"I 'm using a LongAccumulator as a shared counter in map operations . But it seems that I 'm not using it correctly because the state of the counter on the worker nodes is not updated . Here 's what my counter class looks like : As far as I can understand the documentation this should work fine when the application is run within multiple worker nodes : Accumulators are variables that are only “ added ” to through an associative and commutative operation and can therefore be efficiently supported in parallel . They can be used to implement counters ( as in MapReduce ) or sums . Spark natively supports accumulators of numeric types , and programmers can add support for new types.But here is the result when the counter is incremented on 2 different workers and as it looks like the state is not shared between the nodes : INFO Counter : Incrementing counter with id : 866 on thread : Executor task launch worker-6 INFO Counter : Counter 's value with id : 866 is : 1 on thread : Executor task launch worker-6 INFO Counter : Incrementing counter with id : 866 on thread : Executor task launch worker-0 INFO Counter : Counter 's value with id : 866 is : 1 on thread : Executor task launch worker-0Do I understand the accumulators conception wrong or is there any setting that I must start the task with ?"
"we have been simplifying some definition and usage of generics in our code.Now we got an interesting case , take this example : Now look at the method 'doSeomthingWeird ( ) in MyWeirdClass : This code will compile correctly using the eclipse JDT compiler , however it will fail when using the Oracle compiler . Since the JDT is able to produce working byte-code , it means that at JVM level , this is valid code and it is 'only ' the Oracle compiler not allowing to compile such dirty ( ! ? ) stuff.We understand that Oracle 's compiler wo n't accept the call 'T obj = getMyClass ( ) ; ' since T is not a really existent type . However since we know that the returned object implements A and B , why not allowing it ? ( The JDT compiler and the JVM do ) .Note also that since the generics code is used only internally in private methods , we do not want to expose them at class level , polluting external code with generics definitions , that we are not interested at ( from outside the class ) .The school book solution will be to create an interface AB extends A , B however since we have a larger number of interfaces which are used in different combinations and coming from different modules , making shared interfaces for all the combinations will significantly increase the number of 'dummy ' interfaces and finally make the code less readable . In theory it would require up to N-permutations of different wrapper interfaces in order to cover all the cases.The 'business-oriented-engineer ' ( other people call it the 'lazy-engineer ' ) solution would be to leave the code this way and start using only JDT for compiling the code.Edit : It 's a bug in Oracle 's Javac 6 and works without problems also on Oracle 's Javac 7What do you mean ? Are there any hidden dangers by adopting this 'strategy ' ? Addition in order to avoid discussion on ( for me ) not relevant points : I am not asking why the code above does not compile on Oracle 's compiler I know the reason and I do not want to modify this kind of code without a very good reason if it works perfectly when using another compiler.Please concentrate on the definition and usage ( without giving a specific type ) of the method 'doSomethingWeird ( ) '.Is there a good reason , why we should not use only the JDT compiler that allows writing and compiling this code and stop compiling with the Oracle 's compiler , which will not accept the code above ? ( Thanks for input ) Edit : The code above compiles correctly on Oracle Javac 7 but not on Javac 6 . It is a Javac 6 bug .

"Section 3.2.1 of Goetz 's `` Java Concurrency in Practice '' contains the following rule : Do not allow the this reference to escape during constructionI understand that , in general , allowing this to escape can lead to other threads seeing incompletely constructed versions of your object and violate the initialization safety guarantee of final fields ( as discussed e.g . here ) But is it ever possible to safely leak this ? In particular , if you establish a happen-before relationship prior to the leakage ? For example , the official Executor Javadoc says Actions in a thread prior to submitting a Runnable object to an Executor happen-before its execution begins , perhaps in another thread My naive reading understanding of the Java memory model this is that something like the following should be safe , even though it 's leaking this prior to the end of the constructor : That is , even though we have leaked this to a potentially malicious Executor , the assignments to str1 and str2 happen-before the leakage , so the object is ( for all intents and purposes ) completely constructed , even though it has not been `` completely initialized '' per JLS 17.5.Note that I also am requiring that the class be final , as any subclass 's fields would be initialized after the leakage.Am I missing something here ? Is this actually guaranteed to be well-behaved ? It looks to me like an legitimate example of `` Piggybacking on synchronization '' ( 16.1.4 ) In general , I would greatly appreciate any pointers to additional resources where these issues are covered . EDIT : I am aware that , as @ jtahlborn noted , I can avoid the issue by using a public static factory . I 'm looking for an answer of the question directly to solidify my understanding of the Java memory model.EDIT # 2 : This answer alludes to what I 'm trying to get at . That is , following the rule from the JLS cited therein is sufficient for guaranteeing visibility of all final fields . But is it necessary , or can we make use of other happen-before mechanisms to ensure our own visibility guarantees ?"

"So here 's my conundrum . I am programming a tool that needs to work on old versions of our application . I have the code to the application , but can not alter any of the classes .

Below is the DTO class.The DTO is instantiated through a Hibernate query as follows : Now , a little logic is needed on top of the data object , so I made a wrapper class for it . Note the DTO stores an instance of the wrapper class , not the original data object.This works well until I need to work on version 2.0 of our application .

"I have a picture that I elaborate with my program to obtain a list of coordinates.Represented in the image there is a matrix.In an ideal test i would get only the sixteen central points of each square of the matrix.But in actual tests i take pretty much noise points.I want to use an algorithm to extrapolate from the list of the coordinates , the group formed by 16 coordinates that best represent a matrix.The matrix can have any aspect ratio ( beetween a range ) and can result a little rotated.But is always an 4x4 matrix.The matrix is not always present in the image , but is not a problem , i need only the best matching.Of course the founded point are always more than 16 ( or i skip ) Example of founded points : Example of desidered result : If anyone can suggest me a preferred way to do this would be great.Im thinking about the euclidean distance beetween points.at the end if i have 16 points in the list , this could be a matrix.Any better suggestion ?

"We have a situation where we need one application to be able to connect to to two versions of kafka ( 0.7.2 and 0.10.0+ ) and act as a router . I 'm trying to omit using two runtimes here as we need this to be stupid fast , so want to prevent additional serialization/deserialization when sending data between runtimes.To do this , i 've tryied to repackage the old kafka driver from package kafka to old.kafka like so : I 'm using dependency plugin to unpack kafka classes to target/classes & shade plugin to repackage them . The reason for this is that the final jar should act as if it is a kafka driver jar ( it has no other transitive dependencies , therefore it ca n't cause some mismatch using kafka instead of old.kafka . But that 's not really the point here , just trying to prevent out-of-topic questions.The main problem here is that when i look at the jar that has been installed to .m2 , it looks correct ( having the old.kafka package ) : But when i try to use this jar as dependency like so ... ... and reference it in a class like so ... ... the import it self is not working . I have a suspicion that the shaded jar is missing something maven-related , but have n't noticed anything . Another possible though is that shade plugin or asm does n't like the bytecode that scala classes are generating ."
"I have developed a full suite of automated tests using Java , Selenium , Junit , Maven.For each test , they have one or more @ Category annotations describing what area of the software each test covers . For instance : What I 'm trying to do is find a way to get a count of how many tests contain any given category . All the possible categories are filenames in the //com/example/core/categories folder as a source list.I 've tried building a shell script to do a word count , which seems to work okay , but I would think there would be something more `` built-in '' to deal with @ Category.My biggest issue is that even if I get the right count , it is very possible that one or more of the tests are marked @ Ignore which should nullify that tests @ Category 's but without heavy use of flags and reading every file line-by-line in order it throws off the correct count.Is there a good way to itemize @ Category 's that also factors in @ Ignore ?

"I came across a strange effect in connection with annotations on method parameters in a nested class . Looks very much like a compiler issue to me . See below for details and steps to reproduce.Compile the following class with javac ( I used javac 1.7.0_51 ) . Note the annotated parameter `` boolean param3 '' .Then examine the nested class with javap ( i.e . javap -p -v -c TestAnnotations $ TestInner.class ) . Its constructor looks as follows.Note the number of annotations in the attribute RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations - it 's 3 . At the same time we now observe 4 method parameters because of one additional test.TestAnnotations at the beginning ( it is used to pass a reference to TestAnnotations.this into the inner class ) . This means , @ MyAnnotation is now refering to Object param2 , shifted by 1 to the left.According to the Virtual Machine Specification the number of annotations should be the same as the number of method parameters : num_parameters The value of the num_parameters item gives the number of parameters of the method represented by the method_info structure on which the annotation occurs . ( This duplicates information that could be extracted from the method descriptor ( §4.3.3 ) . ) Here we clearly see a violation . Does anyone know the reason ? Is it really what it seems to be , just a compiler bug ?"

"I recently learned about streams in Java 8 and started to work with them . Now I have a question regarding the groupingBy collector method : Usually I work with .NET , so I compared ( knowing they are not the same ) Java Stream < T > with .NET IEnumerable < T > . Following this comparison , List < T > stores elements and the particular Stream/IEnumerable applies operations . One example : C # : Java : In both examples , I start with a list , define operations ( a filter in this example ) and collect the result to store it ( in a new list in this example ) .Now I got a more complex case : The result of this query is a Map < String , Long > and I can work with this , but lets say , I want to proceed with this data instead of storing it . My current approach is trivial : But this way , I leave the stream , store the first result in a Map and open a new stream to continue . Is there a way to group without a collector , so that I can `` stay '' in the stream ?"

"I 've been looking at a lot of code recently ( for my own benefit , as I 'm still learning to program ) , and I 've noticed a number of Java projects ( from what appear to be well respected programmers ) wherein they use some sort of immediate down-casting.I actually have multiple examples , but here 's one that I pulled straight from the code : And from the same project , here 's another ( perhaps more concise ) example : In the first example , you can see that the method has a return type of Set < Coordinates > - however , that specific method will always only return a HashSet - and no other type of Set.In the second example , liveCellCoordinates is initially defined as a Set < Coordinates > , but is immediately turned into a HashSet.And it 's not just this single , specific project - I 've found this to be the case in multiple projects.I am curious as to what the logic is behind this ? Is there some code-conventions that would consider this good practice ? Does it make the program faster or more efficient somehow ? What benefit would it have ?"
"Q . Are you still following the principle of Program to an Interface if you are creating abstract methods in an abstract class that is not linked to an interface ? I use an Interface already for all of my UI classes that I have created ; however , given the reason for the Interface , I do n't see a direct correlation with the abstract method that I want to create and the already existing Interface.Normally , I would just create the abstract method and be done ; however , I am wondering if I am breaking the design principle of Program to an Interface or not.Q . Should I create another interface for this or just stick with the abstract method ?

The base class deals with some overridden methods , helper methods , initialization , etc ... So it is not acting like an interface , but as your standard abstract class ."

"The definition of a functional Interface in Java 8 says : A functional interface is defined as any interface that has exactly one explicitly declared abstract method .

"I need to do the following arithmetic : While the result is guaranteed to fit in long , the multiplication is not , so it can overflow.I tried to do it step by step ( first multiply and then divide ) while dealing with the overflow by splitting the intermediate result of a*b into an int array in size of max 4 ( much like the BigInteger is using its int [ ] mag variable ) .Here I got stuck with the division .

"We 've recently started running into crashes in our Android app due to the app being open in multiple processes . Several different errors point towards that .

Keep in mind that multi-process Android apps execute the code in your Application class in all processes , so you may need to avoid initializing FirebaseDatabase in your Application class .

"I am working on an open source project , Storj . I am writing a Java client which connects to a Node.js websocket backend . The client uses Tyrus .

"My application logs the usage of certain objects - my setup uses AspectJ to identify the contexts I 'm interested in and logs these usages . I later load the log files for analysis , but for efficiency reasons it 's useful to know when an object is no longer reachable.My current approach is to log the objects I 'm interested in with a 'garbage logger ' , which then creates a 'saver ' object containing the object 's identity hash code and stores this in a weak hash map . The idea being that when the object is collected , the saver object will be removed from the weak hash map and collected , thus running code to log the identity hash code of the collected object . I use a separate thread and queue to prevent causing a bottleneck in the garbage collector . Here 's the garbage logger code : My problem is that this seems very convoluted and , because weak hash map wo n't necessarily clear its entries unless space is needed , I might be waiting a long time after the object is collected before recording it . Basically , I 'm looking for a better way to achieve this.Note - I am monitoring arbitrary objects and have no control over their creation so can not override their finalize methods ."
"To my shock , it turns out that the following code will compile without even warnings : Whereas this gives a compile-time error , as you would expect : I checked it up and indeed , the JLS ( section 15.26.2 ) has this to say : A compound assignment expression of the form E1 op = E2 is equivalent to E1 = ( T ) ( ( E1 ) op ( E2 ) ) , where T is the type of E1 , except that E1 is evaluated only once.This seems ridiculous to me . Why did they feel the need to explicitly cast here ? It seems that automatic type conversion would have handled the widening anyway , and automatically narrowing like this is pretty much guaranteed to result in integer overflow ."

"This might sound stupid , but why does n't the Java compiler warn about the expression in the following if statement : I realize why the expression is untrue , but AFAIK , a can never be equal to the String literal `` something '' .

"I 've heard that this is the case , but I could n't find a definitive online source to confirm it.Background : A colleague likes to make his local variables final . One of his reasons for doing so is performance . My contention is that Java 's HotSpot Just In Time compiler will automatically detect invariant local variables , and make them final , so there is no performance benefit to doing that ourselves.Note that I 'm not asking whether it 's good coding practice to make local variables final , because there are already plenty of ( off-topic ) SO questions about that.EDIT : mrhobo makes a good point about optimization of the bytecode for integer literals . I should have given an example of the type of code I was talking about , with my question : Do you think the same type of optimization happens in this scenario , because bar and baz are both marked final ? Or does HotSpot automatically detect that they 're not changing within the scope of the method , and treat them as final anyway ? Similar QuestionsDeclaring local variable as final in a loopsame question , but derives the answer empirically ( by looking at classfiles ) , with no documentation referenceDo javac or Hotspot automatically add 'final ' as an optimisation of invariant variables ? same question for instance variablesInlining in Javasame question for methodsDoes use of final keyword in Java improve the performance ? similar question , with no consensus for local variables"
"Something weird has happened . I 've written a Java program , where I 've done nothing to handle uncaught exceptions in any special way . But when I run this one particular program in Windows 7 , there is this uncaught exception in a static context called from main that causes a window to pop up , displaying the exception . I have tried to write a small program to duplicate this effect to no avail . One program ( which I have written entirely by hand ) produces a popup , while no others will do the same.I 'd like to track this down particularly so that I can add code that makes other CAUGHT exceptions display the stack trace in a similar way.I 've asked about this in IRC , but people tell me that this does n't happen . Well , it DID happen . There is a screenshot below . I think my only hope is if someone else recognizes this and can tell me where it comes from.Thanks ! UPDATE : Sorry for the delay getting some code . I had to attend to a colicky infant . Please note that this is a desktop Java app . It 's not an applet , and it does n't use webstart.Here is code copied and pasted from the program that gets the dialog . I 'll do another edit to let you know whether or not my colleague ( who gets the exception ) gets the dialog for this case . I 've been careful to include everything leading up to the exception . Only the IPAddress class implementation is missing , but that does n't participate in the exception , because it 's not actually used until after the exception occurs . Note the asterisks before the line where the exception occurs . That line of code corresponds with the exception you can see in the screenshot.SECOND UPDATE : My colleague reports that this program does NOT produce the dialog . The only difference between this and the program that gets the pop-up is that the program that gets the pop-up is being launched from an exe wrapper produced by AdvancedInstaller . Besides that , within the Java program , the sequence of execution is identical . I 've googled this , and as far as I can find , AdvancedInstaller does nothing at all that would result in this pop-up being generated . I 'm not sure that it CAN without modifying the Java program ( which it does n't ) , because I 'm not sure that you can do anything from outside the Java program to make this happen . Except perhaps capture stderr , but that does n't explain why other programs wrapped by AdvancedInstaller do n't produce this pop-up or why later exceptions produced by this application also do not produce this pop-up ."

In fact , code must never rely on implementation-specific details , but on the spec instead.I know that today , with JDK 8 , if I have i.e . a HashSet and do this ( taken from the linked answer ) : Then the iteration order of the elements will change and the two outputs will differ . This is because adding and removing 100 elements to the set changes the internal capacity of the HashSet and rehashes elements . And this is perfectly valid behavior . I 'm not asking about this here.However , with JDK9 , if I do this : And then , in another instance of the JVM , I run the same code , the outputs can be different , because randomization has been introduced.So far , I 've found this excellent video in youtube ( minute 44:55 ) , in which Stuart Marks says that one motivation for this randomization is : ( ... ) that people write applications that have inadvertent dependencies on iteration order . ( ... ) So , anyway , iteration order is a big deal and I think there 's a lot of code out there that has latent dependencies on iteration order that has not been discovered yet . ( ... ) So , our response to this is to deliberately randomize the iteration order in Set and Map in the new collections . So whereas before the iteration order of collections was unpredictable but stable , these are predictably unpredictable . So every time the JVM starts up , we get a random number and we use that at as a seed value that gets mixed in with the hash values . So , if you run a program that initializes a set and then prints out the elements in any order , you get an answer , and then , if you invoke the JVM again and run that same program , the set of elements usually would come out in a different order . So , the idea here is that ( ... ) if there are iteration order dependencies in your code , what used to happen in the past , is a new JDK release came out and you test your code and ( ... ) it 'd take hours of debugging to trace it down to some kind of change in iteration order . What that meant was there was a bug in that code that depended on the iteration order . Now , if you vary the iteration order more often , like every JVM invocation , then ( we hope ) that weird behavior will manifest itself more frequently , and in fact we hope while you 're doing testing ... So , the motivation is clear , and it 's also clear that this randomization will only affect the new immutable sets and maps.My question is : Are there any other motivations for this randomization and what advantages does it have ?"
"I have a problem with hashCode ( ) that delegates to uninitialized objects using hibernate.My data-model looks as follows ( the following code is highly pruned to stress the problem and thus broken , do not replicate ! ) : Please note that the implementation of hashCode ( ) thoroughly follows the advice as given in the hibernate documentation . Now if I load an object of type Compound , it eagerly loads the HasSet with the parts . This calls the hashCode ( ) on the parts , which in turn calls the hashCode ( ) on the compound . However the problem is that at this point , not all values that are considered for creating the hashCode of the compound are yet available . Therefore , the hashCode of the parts changes after initialization is complete , thus braking the contract of the HashSet and leading to all kinds of difficult-to-track-down errors ( like e.g . having the same object in the parts set twice ) .So my question is : What is the simplest solution to avoid this problem ( I 'd like to avoid writing classes for custom loading/initialization ) ? Do I do anything wrong here entirely ? Edit : Am I missing something here ? This seems to be a basic problem , why do n't I find anything about it anywhere ? Instead of using the database identifier for the equality comparison , you should use a set of properties for equals ( ) that identify your individual objects . [ ... ] No need to use the persistent identifier , the so called `` business key '' is much better . It 's a natural key , but this time there is nothing wrong in using it ! ( article from hibernate ) And It is recommended that you implement equals ( ) and hashCode ( ) using Business key equality . Business key equality means that the equals ( ) method compares only the properties that form the business key . It is a key that would identify our instance in the real world ( a natural candidate key ) . ( hibernate documentation ) Edit : This is the stack trace when the loading happens ( in case this helps ) . At that point in time , the attribute someUniqueName is null and thus the hashCode is calculated wrongly ."

"I 've noticed periodic , but consistent latency spikes from my app running on app engine . At first I thought the network may be slow but app stats confirmed that not to be the case . I 've been able to reproduce the latency spikes using older and newer versions of the SDKs , currently I 'm using the following : App engine SDK : 1.9.42Google cloud endpoints : 1.9.42Objectify : 5.1.13Appstats ( to debug network latency ) So usage on the app is pretty low , over the last 30 days I 'm generally under 0.04 requests a second : Most work is done with one instance as well : Most operations ' latency is well under a second , but an alarming number of requests take 10-30x longer . So I figured it must just be network latency , but every appstat of a slower operation disproved this . Datastore and the network have always been incredibly reliable . Here is the anatomy of a slow request taking over 30 seconds : Here is the anatomy of a normal request : At a high level my code is pretty uninteresting : it 's a simple api that makes a few network calls and saves / reads data from the cloud datastore . The entire source can be found on github here . The app runs on a single auto scaling app engine instance and is warmed up . CPU usage over the last month doesnt seem to show anything exciting either : It 's really strange to see that even for quick operations , a huge percentage of time is spent on the CPU , even though the code simply creates a few objects , persists them , and returns JSON . I 'm wondering if the CPU is getting pegged on my app engine instance by another app which could be causing performance to periodically degrade . My appengine.xml config looks like this : And my web.xml looks like this : TLDR I 'm completely stuck and I 'm not sure how to debug or fix this issue and I 'm starting to think this is business as usual for smaller apps on app engine.I 'm thinking about turning off the resident instance for a while hoping that my app has just been running some bunk hardware or along side an app that is consuming alot of resources . Has anyone run into similar performance issues or knows of additional ways to profile your app ? EDIT : I 've tried running on 1 resident instance , I 've also tried setting concurrent requests at 2-4 per this question with no results . Logs and appstats both confirm that an inordinate amount of time is spent waiting for my code to initially run . Here is a request that takes 25 seconds before my first line of code is run , not sure what endpoints / app engine is doing in this time . Again load is still low and this is request is on a warmed up instance . EDIT 2 : Seems like for whatever reason app engine + endpoints doesnt play well with min-idle-instances set .

I want to understand how inline functions impact classes.dex and count of methods at all . From my understanding inline function should have zero overhead over methods count . However APK analyzer gives me opposite result.I wrote small test to check this.InlineFunction.kt file : And MainActivity.kt file : From perspective of generated code it looks pretty clear : As we can see there is no call of additional method . But if I open apk with analyzer I can see that this method impacts defined and references methpds count.On the other hand Kotlin stdlib impacts only referenced methods count and does not defined ones.So what am I missing ? I ca n't find how any good source about inlining methods in Android and how it is impact performance as well as I ca n't find any documentation how dex methods count is calculated . I found Jake Wharton utility but if it works correct than all methods from Kotlin library impacts methods count . And it also means that something wrong in this answer https : //stackoverflow.com/a/39635849/4727432 ... Standard library is very small and many of its functions are inline-only which mean they do n't exist past compilation and just become inline code . Proguard can take care of a lot as well ... So how does inline functions impact methods count ? Any articles or posts which explain dex method counting process are welcome .

"I have a Mortar application , with a MortarActivityScope as the first child under the root scope . The MortarActivityScope has an ActivityScope which @ Provides an activity for injected classes : This is fine until an orientation change happens . In the Mortar sample project , the Activity scope is not destroyed on orientation changes . This is presumably to allow @ Singleton presenters , screens etc . to persist across orientation changes . You can see this in the onDestroy ( ) method in the sample project 's main activity : However , doing it this way means that the old ObjectGraph persists across orientation changes . I have observed that Mortar.requireActivityScope does not replace the module from the old activity scope with the new module provided by the new Blueprint .

"In a Java EE 6 application running on GlassFish ( 3.1.2.2b5 ) , suppose you have a ConfigurationService , which reads some properties files and hands out property values accordingly : There also is an Eclipselink SessionCustomizer , because the schema name of one of the persistence units ( Oracle database ) in the application needs to be programmatically set , i.e . be configurable from the properties files mentioned before . The SessionCustomizer is configured in a persistence.xml and the implementation contains a reference to the ConfigurationService : Is it possible to have the ConfigurationService injected in such a way , so that it 's available when the SessionCustomizer is instantiated ? The above fails since the ConfigurationService instance is still null , i.e . the injection has n't happened yet . This observation corresponds to the server 's log entries . It seems like the dependency injection mechanism is invariably started after the persistence units - and thus the SessionCustomizer - are instatiated . I 've messed around with various annotations ( @ Startup , @ DependsOn ( ... ) , ... ) but to no avail . Is my conclusion correct or is there another way to have the EJB instantiated and injected sooner ?"

"Now a little background . I am using this class as a super class to a bunch of different classes which represent objects from an XML file . This is basically an implementation of an API wrapper and I am using this as an adapter between the parsed XML from an API and a database . Casting is delegated to the caller of the get method . If the subclasses need to do something when they are created or when they return a variable , they just call super and then manipulate what gets returned afterwards . eg . : The reason I feel like I should do this is so I do n't have to write getId , getName , getWhatever methods for every single subclass just because they have different attributes .

"J. Bloch in his effective Java provides a several rules for the implementation for equals method . Here they are : • Reflexive : For any non-null reference value x , x.equals ( x ) mustreturn true.• Symmetric : For any non-null reference values x and y , x.equals ( y ) must return true if and only if y.equals ( x ) returns true.• Transitive : For any non-null reference values x , y , z , ifx.equals ( y ) returns true and y.equals ( z ) returns true , thenx.equals ( z ) must return true.• Consistent : For any non-null referencevalues x and y , multiple invocations of x.equals ( y ) consistentlyreturn true or consistently return false , provided no information usedin equals comparisons on the objects is modified.• For any non-nullreference value x , x.equals ( null ) must return false.But later in the book he mentioned so-called Liskov substitution principle : The Liskov substitution principle says that any important property ofa type should also hold for its subtypes , so that any method writtenfor the type should work equally well on its subtypesI do n't see how it ties to the equals contracts . Should we actually adhere to it while writing the equals implementation ? The question is about implementing the method for subclasses .

"Please go through the entire question to have complete idea .

But still ; logically , I feel that adding modifier static to method in eq-1 should not generate compile time error because wherever the method in eq-2 is called it will be responsibility of that method to call with correct argument to method in eq-2 and it should be allowed to be called like a static method .

"This question was inducted by this StackOverflow question about unsafe casts : Java Casting method without knowing what to cast to . While answering the question I encountered this behaviour I could n't explain based on purely the specificationI found the following statement in The Java Tutorials at theOracle docs : Insert type casts if necessary to preserve type safety . The Java Tutorials : Type Erasure It is not explained what `` if necessary '' means exactly , andI 've found no mention about these casts in the Java LanguageSpecification at all , so I started to experiment.Let 's look at the following piece of code : Compiled with javac and decompiled with the Java Decompiler : I can see that there is a cast which ensures type safety in the first case , but in the second case it is omitted . It isfine of course , because I want to store the return value in an Objecttyped variable , so the cast is not strictly necessary as per type safety . However it leads to an interesting behaviour with unsafe casts : Compiled and decompiled , I see no type cast to ensure correct return type at runtime : This means that if a generic function should return an object of a giventype , it is not guaranteed it will return that type ultimately . Anapplication using the above code will fail at the first point where it triesto cast the return value to an Integer if it does so at all , so I feel likeit breaks the fail-fast principle.What are the exact rules of the compiler inserting this cast duringcompilation that ensures type safety and where are those rules specified ? EDIT : I see that the compiler will not dig into the code and try to prove that the generic code really returns what it should , but it could insert an assertation , or at least a type cast ( which it already does in specific cases , as seen in the first example ) to ensure correct return type , so the latter would throw a ClassCastException :"

"Suppose you 're maintaining an API that was originally released years ago ( before java gained enum support ) and it defines a class with enumeration values as ints : Over the years the API has evolved and gained Java 5-specific features ( generified interfaces , etc ) .

I 'm concerned that mixing two styles of enumeration is inconsistent for users of the API.I see three possible approaches : Give up and define the new enum ( NutrientType in my fictitious example ) as a series of ints like the VitaminType class . You get consistency but you 're not taking advantage of type safety and other modern features.Decide to live with an inconsistency in a published API : keep VitaminType around as is , and add NutrientType as an enum . Methods that take a VitaminType are still declared as taking an int , methods that take a NutrientType are declared as taking such.Deprecate the VitaminType class and introduce a new VitaminType2 enum . Define the new NutrientType as an enum . Congratulations , for the next 2-3 years until you can kill the deprecated type , you 're going to deal with deprecated versions of every single method that took a VitaminType as an int and adding a new foo ( VitaminType2 v ) version of each . You also need to write tests for each deprecated foo ( int v ) method as well as its corresponding foo ( VitaminType2 v ) method , so you just multiplied your QA effort.What is the best approach ?"

"BackgroundHaving noticed that the execution of a java program I am working on was slower than expected , I decided to tinker with the area of code which I thought may be causing the issue - a call to Math.pow ( x , 2 ) from within a for loop . Contrary to another questions on this site , a simple benchmark I created ( code at end ) found that replacing Math.pow ( x , 2 ) with x*x actually sped the loop up by almost 70 times : Note that I am aware that the benchmark is not perfect , and that the values should certainly be taken with a pinch of salt - the aim of the benchmark was to get a ballpark figure.The QuestionWhile the benchmark gave interesting results it did not model my data accurately , as my data consists largely of 0 's . Thus a more accurate test was to run the benchmark without the for loop marked optional . According to the javadoc for Math.pow ( ) If the first argument is positive zero and the second argument is greater than zero , or the first argument is positive infinity and the second argument is less than zero , then the result is positive zero.So it would be expected that this benchmark would run faster right ! ? In reality however , this is considerably slower again : Sure , one may expect the math.pow ( ) code to run a little slower than the simple x*x code due to the fact that it needs to work for the general case , but 700x slower ? What is going on ! ? And why is the 0 case so much slower than the Math.random ( ) case ? UPDATE : Updated code and times based on @ Stephen C 's suggestion . This however made little difference.Code used to benchmarkNote that reordering the two tests makes negligible difference ."

I tried to optimize the RAM usage of a Android game by changing int primitives to shorts . Before I did this I was interested in the performance of the primitive types in Java.So I created this little test benchmark using the caliper library.The results of the test surprised me.Test circumstancesBenchmark run under the Caliper library.Test resultshttps : //microbenchmarks.appspot.com/runs/0c9bd212-feeb-4f8f-896c-e027b85dfe3bInt 2.365 nsLong 2.436 nsShort 8.156 nsTest conclusion ? The short primitive type is significantly slower ( 3-4~ times ) than the long and int primitive type ? QuestionWhy is the short primitive significantly slower than int or long ? I would expect the int primitive type to be the fastest on a 32bit VM and the long and short to be equal in time or the short to be even faster.Is this also the case on Android phones ? Knowing that Android phones in general run in a 32bit environment and now the days more and more phones start to ship with 64bit processors .

"While answering to a question about that here : https : //stackoverflow.com/a/9872630/82609I tried to do the following : It works ! But the following does n't : On the related question , i made the assumption : I guess it 's because initially the array contract may be something like this : If you create an array of type X , you will NEVER EVER be able to put anything in it that IS-NOT-AN X . If you try , you 'll get an ArrayStoreException Thus allowing arrays with generics creation would lead to a different rule like : If you create an array of type X < Y > , you will NEVER EVER be able to put anything that IS-NOT-AN X . If you try , you 'll get an ArrayStoreException . But you CAN add both X < Y > and X < Z > objects because of type erasure ! But thinking about it , would it really be a problem to have : I do n't really understand why it 's not possible , since using such a thing would : Check the classes inserted at runtime Check the classes type inserted at compile timeFinally we can use an array with generic type reference and because of the impossibility to create an array with a generic type , i think many people do not even know it 's possible.I just wonder if someone knows the reason behind this choice ? It 's a bit like forcing people to use List < String > = new ArrayList ( ) ; instead of using List < String > = new ArrayList < String > ( ) ; dimitrisli you gave a nice exemple from Joshua Bloch 's famous book.As you/he explained it , it is dangerous to use both generic arrays + covariance and could lead to ClassCastException while we expect ArrayStoreException from an array with use of covariance.But please notice the following is still legal and lead to the same : However it produces an unchecked cast warning at compile time , and as you mentionned , a ClassCastException at runtime ."

"I 'm not sure where to start or what information is relevant please let me know what additional information may be useful in solving this problem.I am developing a simple cometd application and I 'm using mongodb as my storage backend . I obtain a single mongodb instance when the application starts and I use this instance for all queries . This is in fact recommended by the mongo java driver documentation as stated here : http : //www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Java+Driver+Concurrency . I was grasping at straws thinking that the issue had something to do with thread safety but according to that link mongodb is completely thread safe.Here 's where it gets interesting . I have a class that extends BasicDBObject.Next two skeleton classes that extend MyBasicDBObject.The only reason I 've set up my classes this way is to improve code readability in dealing with these two objects within the same scope . This lets me do the following ... The UtilityClass does exactly as the methods are named , bitwise & and bitwise ^ by iterating over the passed byte arrays.This is where I 'm totally lost . updateMapObjectsFoo ( ) works exactly as expected , both first and second reflect the changes in the database . updateMapObjectsBar ( ) on the other hand only manages to properly update first.Inspection via debugging updateMapObjectsBar ( ) shows that the binary objects are in fact updated properly on both objects , but when I head over to the mongo shell to investigate the problem I see that first is updated in the DB and second is not . Where did I get the idea that thread safety had anything to do with it ? The only difference that bugs me is that secondCollection is used by other cometd services while firstCollection is not . That seems relevant in one hand , but not in the other since Foo works and Bar does not.I have torn the code apart and put it back together and I keep coming back to this same problem . What in the world is going on here ? It seems I left out the most relevant part of all which is the nightmare of java generics and the mongodb driver 's reliance on this feature of the language . BasicDBObject is essentially a wrapper for a Map < String , Object > . The problem is that once you store an object in that map , you must cast it back to what it was when you put it in there . Yes that may seem completely obvious , and I knew that full well before posting this question . I can not pinpoint what happened exactly but I will offer this advice to java + mongodb users . You will be casting , A LOT , and the more complicated your data structures the more casts you will need . Long story short , do n't do this : One liners are tempting when you are doing rapid prototypes but when you start doing that over and over you are bound to make mistakes . Write more code now , and suffer less frustration later : I think this is annoyingly verbose but I should expect as much interacting directly with Mongo instead of using some kind of library to make my life easier . I have made a fool of myself on this one , but hopefully someone will learn from my mistake and save themselves a lot of frustration.Thanks to all for your help ."

"This is kind of a follow-up question to a question I asked over here regarding how to paint an applet/window while using SwingWorkerIn this particular instance , I am using a divide and conquer algorithm proposed by Guibas and stolfi to compute a Delaunay triangulation of a set of points say P.The algorithm is as follows:1 . If sizeof ( p ) ==2 , add an edge ; return2 . If sizeof ( p ) ==3 , add a counter-clockwise oriented triangle ; return3 . if sizeof ( p ) > 3 , divide ( p ) into left and right halves . Triangulate the individual halves merge the halves togetherI have a triangulation class whose triangulate method ( as shown in the code block ) will implement the divide and conquer algorithm ( according to the pseudo-code provided by Guibas and Stolfi ) I have a DrawingPanel which acts as a Canvas class and paints the triangles , points on the drawing surface.I am using a SwingWorker in my main Triangulate class to call the triangulate method.Here 's the code for the SwingWorker : Now , I would like to animate this triangulation , by showing the triangulation appearing after the recursive call to the triangulate and then the merge function.Does anybody have some pointers which will help me implement the solution ? I thought about using the publish and process method in the SwingWorker class , but then figured out that would be redundant since the divide and conquer algorithm directly comes up with the final triangulation.Thanks in advance ."

This worked perfectly fine in JDK 8 ; seems like a strange thing to suddenly enforce . Especially considering that there are already compile-time checks in place to ensure final fields are instantiated correctly.Therefore , by the time the function addSuffix is ever accessed , there would need to be a value in place for suffix ( null or otherwise is another story ) .I 'll also note that I 've tried the following code , which compiles fine with JDK9 and ECJ : It appears that in JDK 9 , there is a big difference between anonymous class declarations and Lambda expressions . So in this case where we get a compiler error , at least the ECJ is accurately in mimicking the JDK 9 compiler.Issue with Stream & GenericsThis one really surprised me , because I can not think of why the compiler would interpret this any differently than what the Generic in the code indicates : This code gives these errors : In light of this information , it appears in this case , the ECJ is at fault for not properly mimicking the JDK 9 and is just an Eclipse bug ."

"I 'm tuning an app we run on App Engine and one of the largest costs is data store reads and writes .

"So , the quote comes from `` Dependency Injection in .NET '' . Having that in consideration , is the following class wrongly designed ? So this FallingPiece class has the responsibility of controlling the current falling piece in a tetris game . When the piece hits the bottom or some other place , raises an event signaling that and then , through the factory , generates another new piece that starts falling again from above.The only alternative I see is to have an Initialize ( ) method that would generate the piece , but IMO that goes a bit against the idea of having the constructor put your object in a valid state ."

"The code below is a small example that easily reproduces the issue . So I have variable of type String , on which a default value is set . I have 3 methods : gettersetterconvenience method that converts the string to booleanThe introspection does not return the getter as the readMethod and the setter as the writeMethod . Instead it returns the isTest ( ) method as the readMethod . The setter is empty.From the documentation I understand that if the type would be a boolean , the `` is '' method has higher precedence over get , but the type is String , so it does not make sense to even look for an `` is-xxx '' method ? Is there anyone who has some insight on this ? Additional information : The order does not change the outcome . The isTest ( ) method is always seen as readMethodIn case I simply rename the isTest ( ) to bsTest ( ) , it selects the getter and setter as readMethod and writeMethod . So it has something to do with `` is-xxx '' ."
"We have code with complex Comparators that have been used for sorting java objects throughout our application . Historically these have worked , but since the introduction of TimSort in Java 7 we occasionally get the Comparison method violates its general contract ! error.. depending on what data is held within the object.Here is an example of one of our legacy Comparators ( which could be almost a decade old - excuse the dodgyiness ) : So , I want to replicate this functionality , but with a Comparator that is safe for use with TimSort.From the code you can see that there a multiple levels to this comparison.. It will compare the group codes.If Group codes are the same it will compare sort order.If Sort order is the same it will compare description.Which means it will return the result of the compare at a particular level . Which might be the comparison result of two strings or two integers . I think this is what is breaking the TimSort.The only way I have been able to make this Comparator work around the General Contract issue is by hashing the contents of the bean and performing a string comparison . Other ideas have included writing our own sorting function.. Surely there is a better way ? Should the bean be constructed in another way to support this ?"

"I am new to using optionals in Java 8 . I know the method orElseGet ( ) takes a supplier and orElseThrow ( ) also takes a supplier that throws an exception . orElseThrow ( ) might be a good one to use if I can construct my own exception and do something when that exception is triggered.My main goal is to use a method that will either get the unwrapped value , or if the optional wraps null , then to actually execute an entirely different function . Looking for the closest thing to : If the only way to do this is orElseThrow ( ) , and as long as I can handle the exception with the 'do this instead ' code , that should be fine too . It just makes my codebase larger because I have to create a few different custom utility suppliers for the 2 or 3 cases where some of my optional values would return null.The problem is , .ifPresent ( ) invokes the specified consumer with the value , otherwise does nothing . I need it to DO SOMETHING if the value is null . My current code utilizes a custom workaround where I first check if the value is null , and if it is , execute a chosen function . Then the next statement is the one that checks for ifPresent ( ) . So this is doing the same thing , I am just looking for a more sugar-coated , one statement version ."

"Apologies in advance for a long-winded question . Feedback especially appreciated here . . .In my work , we do a lot of things with date ranges ( date periods , if you will ) . We need to take all sorts of measurements , compare overlap between two date periods , etc . I have designed an Interface , a base class , and several derived classes which serve my needs well to date : IDatePeriod DatePeriodCalendarMonthCalendarWeekFiscalYearStripped to its essentials , the DatePeriod superclass is as follows ( omits all the fascinating features which are the basis for why we need this set of classes . . . ) : ( Java pseudocode ) : The base class contains a bunch of rather specialized methods and properties for manipulating the date period class . The derived classes change only the manner in which the start and end points of the period in question are set . For example , it makes sense to me that a CalendarMonth object indeed `` is-a '' DatePeriod . However , for obvious reasons , a calendar month is of fixed duration , and has specific start and end dates . In fact , while the constructor for the CalendarMonth class matches that of the superclass ( in that it has a startDate and endDate parameter ) , this is in fact an overload of a simplified constructor , which requires only a single Calendar object . In the case of CalendarMonth , providing any date will result in a CalendarMonth instance which begins on the first day of the month in question , and ends on the last day of that same month . Apologies for the long preamble . Given the situation above , it would seem this class structure violates the Liskov substitution principle . While one CAN use an instance of CalendarMonth in any case in which one might use the more general DatePeriod class , the output behavior of key methods will be different . In other words , one must be aware that one is using an instance of CalendarMonth in a given situation . While CalendarMonth ( or CalendarWeek , etc . ) adhere to the contract established through the base class ' use of IDatePeriod , results might become horribly skewed in a situation in which the CalendarMonth was used and the behavior of plain old DatePeriod was expected . . . ( Note that ALL of the other funky methods defined on the base class work properly - it is only the setting of start and end dates which differs in the CalendarMonth implementation ) .Is there a better way to structure this such that proper adherence to LSP might be maintained , without compromising usability and/or duplicating code ?"

"I just ran into a problem caused by Java 's java.awt.geom.Area # equals ( Area ) method . The problem can be simplified to the following unit test : After some head scratching and debugging , I finally saw in the JDK source , that the signature of the equals method in Area looks like this : Note that it does not @ Override the normal equals method from Object , but instead just overloads the method with a more concrete type . Thus , the two calls in the example above end up calling different implementations of equals.As this behavior has been present since Java 1.2 , I assume it is not considered a bug . I am , therefore , more interested in finding out why the decision was made to not properly override the equals method , but at the same time provide an overloaded variant . ( Another hint that this was an actual decision made is the absence of an overwritten hashCode ( ) method . ) My only guess would be that the authors feared that the slow equals implementation for areas is unsuitable for comparing equality when placing Areas in Set , Map , etc . datastructures . ( In the above example , you could add a to a HashSet , and although b is equal to a , calling contains ( b ) will fail . ) Then again , why did they not just name the questionable method in a way that does not clash with such a fundamental concept as the equals method ?"

"Some background , then some questions.I have only recently discovered that an interface ( or class ) may be generic in the type of ( checked ) exception that its methods may throw . For example : The point is if you later instantiate this with , say , IOException and invoke the run method , the compiler knows you need to either catch IOException or mark it as thrown . Better still , if X was a RuntimeException , you do n't need to handle it at all.Here 's a contrived example using the above interface , but it 's basically a callback and should be quite common.We 're calling a generic utility method runTwice ( perhaps defined in an external library ) to run our own specific method with a specific checked exception , and we do n't lose any information about which specific checked exception might be thrown.The alternative would have been to simply use throws Exception on both the Runnable.run method and the runTwice method . This would not restrict any implementation of the Runnable interface but the advantage of checked exceptions would be lost . Or there could have been no throws at all , also losing the advantage of checked exceptions and potentially forcing the implementation to wrap.Because I had never seen throws X , maybe I 've missed something . Furthermore , I have seen the callback example used as an argument against checked exceptions several times without it being refuted . ( This question is not interested in the pros/cons of checked exceptions . ) Is throws X generally a good idea ? What are the pros and cons ? Can you give some examples that either use throws X or did n't but should have ? Basically , I would like some further insight . You might comment on the following examples.OutputStream throws IOException ( perhaps ByteArrayOutputStream could extends GenericOutputStream < RuntimeException > ) Callable / Future.getCommons Pool borrowObject / makeObject ( Since editing , I am not asking if these could/should have been designed differently in retrospect . Rather , would throws X be better than throws Exception . )"

"I 'm using JGit for one of my project that involves intesive use of git.My aim is to use a RevWalk to be able to iterate over the commits in a repository in a chronological order , starting at a specifc commit . I 've managed to achieve both of them separetely : Chronological order by applying a RevSort.REVERSEStarting point by calling RevWalk.markStart ( RevCommit c ) My problem is that when I try to combine the two , it seems that the RevSort overrides the markStart , and the RevWalk always ends up starting at the beginning of the commits instea of the commit that I 've specifiied.This snippet shows what I 've got : This should prints the ID of the repository in reverse order starting at the commit specified , but it just ignore the second setting and starts from the initial commit.UPDATE : I 've investigated more in the problem and it turns out that when applying the two options together ( in any order ) , the markStart becomes a markStop . I think that this is caused by markStart being always executed first and limiting the range of the commits ( with a filter ) , and then having those reversed by the RevSort . Basically , the RevWalk is iterating on the complementary set of commits that I 'm interested in.Should I assume that what I 'm trying to do is not obtainable in this way ? I could n't think of another way to get it without traversing the whole repository up to my starting point , but that sounds highly inefficient.UPDATE 2 : To give a proper example here is what I was expecting to achieve.Assume that we have a repository containing 4 commits : A , B , C and D.I 'm interested only in the comments from B to the current revision , excluding A , in a chronological order . I was hoping to be able to use markStart and sort to achieve that in the following way : Now , from what I 've seen , this does n't work because markStart is always executed before the sort , so the actual behaviour satisfies the following test : That is the opposite of what I 'm trying to obtain.Is this an intented behaviour and , if so , in what other way could I approach the problem ?"

The MacOS build is created using InfiniteKinds fork of AppBundlerThis is the stacktrace : I 'm using Apache Httpclient 4.5.3 and am using this lib because I am getting data from a webservice that requires the use of ssl.UpdateI added Example test to my source code from the answer below , and modified my build to make this the start class when the application is run and it gives me this stacktrace ( when bundle is run from command line with open using the java runtime embedded in the bundle by infinitekind appbundler ) which is difference to one I had before , but maybe this is the underlying cause or is this misleading ? Whereas if I just run java -jar songkong6.9.jar it runs Example and prints out Loaded with no error , If I specify the full path from /Library/Java it also works in all cases ( Java 11/Java 14/JDk and JRE ) UpdateBased on the answer below I have made some progress.The JRE installed on MacOS contains a conf folder , when the JRE is added to my bundle ( SongKong ) using InfiniteKinds appbundler it does not have a conf folder . It doe have a lib/security folder containing a default.policy but this doesnt seem to be enough . After installing the built bundle if I manually copy the conf folder from the installed JRE to the Home folder of the java plugine.g/Applications/SongKong.app/Contents/PlugIns/adoptopenjdk-11.jre/Contents/Homelocation then both the Example code and my original code work without error when ran from bundle.Furthermore what it seems to be looking for is the unlimited folder and its contents ( the two files are actually the same ) , so if I delete a few files so I am left with then it continues to work.Problem ( aside from why it doesnt work out of the box ) is I assume I can not copy files into this location for a hardened runtime app so I need to store these policy files somewhere else so they can be installed as part of the appbundler build . So as a test I have renamed conf folder conf.old folder and added following parameter to the bundleor to replace rather than append policy fileBut it does n't work , I have tried various values but nothing works . The only thing that works is leaving it in conf subfolder and then it does n't matter if I pass this parameter or not . ( I also tried adding -Dsecurity.manager as another option but that just caused a new error about permissions from logging . )"

"I 've been reading a lot about Swing , threading , invokeLater ( ) , SwingWorker , etc. , but I just ca n't seem to get my head around it all , so I was trying to create a really simple program to illustrate . I 've looked at a lot of examples , but none of them seem to show just what I 'm trying to do.Here 's what I 'm trying to do in my example . I have a button and a label , and when I click the button , I want the program to pause for 3 seconds before appending a period to the text of the label . During that 3 seconds , I want the GUI to appear as normal and to continue responding to additional clicks . Here 's what I wrote : with this code , if I click the button , the period is immediately appended to the label , which makes sense to me , because I am creating and sleeping a background thread , leaving the EDT available to update the label immediately . So I tried this : This almost works except that it blocks the EDT causing the button to turn blue for three seconds before appending the period to the label 's text . I do n't want the button to look like it 's being pressed for the whole three seconds when it was really just clicked quickly , so I tried this : This appears to work , but are n't I calling jLabel1.setText ( ... ) from the background thread and not the EDT , and therefore breaking the `` Swing Single Threading Rule ?

"I am having trouble understanding what is actually happening when I declare the array in the following code . I thought since the right-hand side of the array declaration is new Type2 [ 2 ] that the array would consist of reference variables of the type Type2 . If this is true , the first error makes sense because I can not have a subtype referring to a supertype.However , why does the second error occur two lines after that ? Is n't method2 ( ) known by Type2 , so the method is known by the reference variable ? It seems it is because Type1 does n't know method2 , so does that mean the array consists of reference variables of the type Type1 ? If this is true , why does the first error occur as it is no longer a subtype referring to a supertype ? Also , why is the first error a runtime error while the other is a syntax error ? Please note I am only in my second programming course , so my terminology may be a little off . Edit : The question here does not answer my question because it does not answer why an element of an array like x can not invoke method2 ( ) even though an element of x of Type 2 . My question is different because of this and because my question also asks why the first error occurs when the second error also occurs ( why an element of x can not refer to and object of the type Type1 and at the same time can not invoke method2 ( ) ) . I originally thought that if one error occurred , then the other can not occur . I wanted a comparison between the two errors and a more in-depth explanation than simply the rules of polymorphism ."

"It is said in Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software book : In situations where there 's only one implementation ( one-to-one ) , creating an abstract implementor class is n't necessary.This is a degenerate case of the bridge pattern ; there 's a one-to-one relationship between Abstraction and Implementor.Nevertheless , this seperation is still useful when a change in the implementation of a class must not affect its existing clients- that is they should n't have to be recompiled , just relinked.I doubt about the benefit of compile time because I ca n't imagine a case in Java where a change in implementation makes recompile its superclass ( abstract in this case ) .For example , if we have X extends Y and a client do : A change in X does not mean a recompilation of Y ( of course if we do n't want to change the method signatures of X ) It is exactly the same thing when using Bridge Pattern : A change in XImplementor does not mean a recompilation of YAbstraction.So , according to me , this benefit does not take place in Java and for a one-to-one = > no Bridge Pattern needed.Perhaps a change in a subclass force superclass to be recompiled in other languages ? like SmallTalk and C++ ?

"Wikipedia defines virtual methods as : In object-oriented programming , a virtual function or a virtual method is a function or method whose behavior can be overridden within an inheriting class by a function with the same signature [ to provide a polymorphic behavior ] .According to the definition , every non-static method in Java is by default virtual except final and private methods . The method which can not be inherited for polymorphic behavior is not a virtual method.Static methods in Java can never be overridden ; hence , it is meaningless to declare a static method as final in Java because static methods themselves behave just like final methods . They can simply be hidden in sub classes by the methods with the same signature . It is evidently so because static methods can never have polymorphic behavior : a method which is overridden must achieve polymorphism , which is not the case with static methods.From the preceding paragraph , an important conclusion can be driven . All the methods in C++ are by default static because no methods in C++ can behave polymorphically until and unless they are explicitly declared virtual in the super class . In contrast , all the methods in Java except final , static and private methods are by default virtual because they have polymorphic behavior by default ( there 's no need to explicitly declare methods as virtual in Java and , consequently , Java has no keyword like `` virtual '' ) .Now , let 's demonstrate that instance variables ( static too ) can not behave polymorphically from the following simple example in Java.The output produced by the above code snippet is as follows.In this example , both calls s.show ( ) and c.show ( ) made to the show ( ) method through the variables of type Super and of type Child , respectively , invoke the show ( ) method in the Child class . This means that the show ( ) method in the Child class overrides the show ( ) method in the Super class because both of them have the identical signature.This , however , can not be applied to the instance variable a declared in both the classes . In this case , s.a would refer to a in the Super class and display 5 and c.a would refer to a in the Child class and display 6 means that a in the Child class just hides ( and does n't override as happened to non-static methods ) a in the Super class.After this long discussion , there is only one question . Why are instance variables ( and the rest too ) not overridden ? What were the special reasons to implement such a mechanism ? Would have there been any advantages or disadvantages , if they had been overridden ?"
"I 've been reading the book Head First : Design Patterns , which I have found to be a good introduction to design patterns . However , I 've got a question about a claim they make in Chapter 4 : They define the `` Simple Factory '' pattern as follows ( Java pseudocode ) : The `` Factory Method '' is defined as follows ( class Product remains the same and is omitted ) : Then the authors go on to claim that the Factory Method Pattern is much more flexible than Simple Factory , because while Simple Factory is `` a one shot deal , with Factory Method you are creating a framework that lets the subclasses decide which implementation should be used '' ( page 135 ) .Now I do n't get why this is true . The way I see it , Simple Factory is , in some senses , slightly more flexible than Factory Method : you can subclass the Simple Factory ( instead of subclassing the Store ) to get essentially the same behavior . You can even change the behavior at runtime if you wish ! The only disadvantage of Simple Factory I could think of is when the product creation depends on state variables of the Store class : is this what the authors are calling flexibility , or am I missing something ?"

"I 'm studying Effective Java , Item 8 ( Obey the general contract when overriding equals ) . It has been explained quite clearly by the author , but still some parts are not that much elaborated . For this example , he considers a class CaseInsensitiveString defined as : In the end of the article , he says : For some classes , such as CaseInsensitiveString above , field comparisons are more complex than simple equality tests . If this is the case , you may want to store a canonical form of the field , so the equals method can do cheap exact comparisons on these canonical forms rather than more costly inexact compar- isons . This technique is most appropriate for immutable classes ( Item 15 ) ; if the object can change , you must keep the canonical form up to date.I searched for this term and found that it basically means a standard representation of something , like absolute path without any symbolic links for a file in a directory . But I 'm unable to understand the use of 'canonical ' form for this class , which would help here . Any suggestions ?"

"This is Sun JDK 1.6u21 , x64.I have a class for the purpose of experimenting with perm gen usage which contains only a single large string ( 512k characters ) : I check the perm gen usage using getUsage ( ) .toString ( ) on the MemoryPoolMXBean object for the permanent generation ( called `` PS Perm Gen '' in u21 , although it has slightly different names with different versions , or with different garbage collectors.When I first reference the class , say by reading Big0.class , perm gen jumps by ~500 KB - that 's what I 'd expect as the constant pool encoding of the string is UTF-8 , and I 'm using only ASCII characters.When I actually create an instance of this class , however , perm gen jumps by ~2 MB . Since this is a 1 MB string in-memory ( 2 bytes per UTF16 character , certainly no surrogates ) , I 'm confused about why the memory usage is double.The same effect occurs if I make the string static . If I used final , it fails to compile as I exceed the limit for constant pool items of 65535 bytes ( not sure why leaving final off avoids that either - consider that a bonus question ) .Any insight appreciated ! Edit : I should also point out that this occurs with non-static , final non-static , and static strings , but not for final static strings . Since that 's already a best practice for string constants , maybe this is of mostly academic interest ."

"I am trying to make a class that can hold only one of two objects and I want to do this with generics . Here is the idea : Of course this wo n't work though because due to type erasure the constructors have the same type signature . I realize one solution is to have a single constructor taking both , but I want one of the values to be empty , so it seems more elegant to have single parameter constructors.Is there an elegant solution to this ? Edit 1 : I am using Java 6 . Edit 2 : The reason I want to make this is because I have a method that can return one of two types . I made a concrete version with no generics but was wondering if I could make it generic . Yes , I realize that having a method with two different return types is the real issue at hand , but I was still curious if there was a good way to do this . I think durron597 's answer is best because it points out that Union < Foo , Bar > and Union < Bar , Foo > should act the same but they do n't ( which is the main reason why I decided to stop pursuing this ) . This is a much uglier issue than the `` ugly '' constructor . For what it 's worth I think the best option is probably make this abstract ( because interfaces ca n't dictate visibility ) and make the isA and getA stuff protected , and then in the implementing class have better named methods to avoid the < A , B > ! = < B , A > issue . I will add my own answer with more details . Final edit : For what it 's worth , I decided that using static methods as pseudo constructors ( public static Union < A , B > fromA ( A a ) and public static Union < A , B > fromB ( B b ) ) is the best approach ( along with making the real constructor private ) . Union < A , B > and Union < B , A > would never realistically be compared to each other when it 's just being used as a return value . Another edit , 6 months out : I really ca n't believe how naive I was when I asked this , static factory methods are so obviously the absolute correct choice and clearly a no-brainer . All that aside I have found Functional Java to be very intriguing . I have n't used it yet but I did find this Either when googling 'java disjunct union ' , it 's exactly what I was looking for . The downside though it that Functional Java is only for Java 7 and 8 , but luckily the project I am now working on used Java 8 ."

"I am attempting to create an application that draws Fibonacci Arcs similar to these . However , I 'd like full circles instead of arcs , and I 'd like to draw more than the three Fibonacci lines shown in the picture . I 've created an application using JFreeChart to attempt to accomplish this . However , here is the result when trying to draw the same arcs ( but as circles ) shown in the previous picture . Initially , it just looks wrong , but when I zoom out , it is indeed a circle , but it 's way too big . To calculate the arcs , you draw a line , then take a Fibonacci ratio - let 's use .381 for example - the percentage of that line . If you look at the first picture , you 'll see the innermost arc intersects the line at .381 % the distance of the line from the centre of the circle . First I calculate this point . Then I construct a line from the .381 % point to the centre . Then I take the distance of this line , which should be the radius . Then I use this radius to draw the circle . Here 's the code to calculate the radius . Where stop and start are the stop and start points of the line drawn.Here is the code to calculate the distance of a lineI get back a list of circle objects ( this is an object I created that holds the radius and centre point ) one for each circle that needs to be drawn and then draw them . I think the issue has something to do with how the x-axis of time and the y axis of price does n't exactly correlate . What I mean is , if the radius is 20 , you 'll be going 20 units away from the centre at each point . So say you 're stock price is only 5 dollars , at your lowest point you will then be at -15 .

"The attached program ( see at the end ) , when executed , yields the following output : In both cases the exact same code is executed which is to repeatedly get the next value from a Random object instantiated which at the start of the program . The warm up method executed first is supposed to trigger any sort of JIT otimizations before the actual testing begins.Can anyone explain the reason for this difference ? I have been able to repeat this result in my machine every time so far , and this was executed on a multi-core Windows system with java 7.One interesting thing is that if the order in which the tests are executed is reversed , that is , if we run the loop with the delay before the loop without the delay , then the timings are more similar ( with the no delay loop actually taking longer ) : As much as I could tell , no object is being created inside the operation method , and when running this through a profiler it does not seem that garbage collection is ever triggered . A wild guess is that some value gets cached in a processor-local cache which gets flushed out when the thread is put to sleep and then when the thread wakes up it needs to retrieve the value from main memory , but that is not so fast . That however does not explain why inverting the order makes a difference ...

"I have a problem with creation of AudioInputStream from Socket . Here are the important parts : This code throws UnsupportedAudioFileException at this line : However when I use this code : it plays the sound but only after it loads those 100000 sample frames to the audioinputstream . After it plays all the 100000 frames it finishes.I guess that I would solve this issue if I could pass the AudioFormat directly as a parameter during the first AudioInputStream inicialization , but it does n't seem to be possible . I 'm receiving the audio format specifications from server.I think that one possible solution would be to create a dataline which I can pass as a parametr to AudioInputStream constructor . However I 'm not sure how to get the data from the socket directly to dataline . I know of a solution that uses infinite loop , in which it reads the data and writes them to the dataline . But it seems to be wasteful . Is there a more direct approach ? I hope it 's possible to solve using java-openAL library , because I need to change the speed and I hope I wo n't have to do it myself.Thanks"
"As this question asked for python , what is the equivalent of Haskell 's scanl in Java 's streams ?

"I read this Java 8 official docs : Streams may or may not have a defined encounter order . Whether or not a stream has an encounter order depends on the source and the intermediate operations . Certain stream sources ( such as List or arrays ) are intrinsically ordered , whereas others ( such as HashSet ) are not . If a stream is ordered , repeated execution of identical stream pipelines on an identical source will produce an identical result ; if it is not ordered , repeated execution might produce different results.Tried to understand the mentioned behaviour through this codeI ran this code many a times and the order of elements in resulting stream was always the same ( shown as comment ) .

"A Java lambda referencing an element from its enclosing scope holds a reference to its enclosing object . A contrived example , with lambda holding ref to MyClass : This is problematic if the lifetime of the lambda is long ; then we 've got a ref to MyClass that is long-lived , when it would have otherwise gone out of scope . Here we can optimize by replacing the lambda with a private static class , so that we 're only holding a reference to the String we need rather than to the entire class : Unfortunately this is super verbose and destroys the nice syntax we get from using ( effectively final ) variables from enclosing scope in lambdas . Is this technically optimal ? Is there always a tradeoff here between nice syntax and the possibility of keeping a ref longer than necessary ?"

"In his book Effective Java , Joshua Bloch recommends against using Interfaces to hold constants , The constant interface pattern is a poor use of interfaces . That a class uses some constants internally is an implementation detail . Implementing a constant interface causes this implementation detail to leak into the class ’ s exported API . It is of no consequence to the users of a class that the class implements a constant interface . In fact , it may even confuse them . Worse , it represents a commitment : if in a future release the class is modified so that it no longer needs to use the con-stants , it still must implement the interface to ensure binary compatibility . If a nonfinal class implements a constant interface , all of its subclasses will have their namespaces polluted by the constants in the interface.His reasoning makes sense to me and it seems to be the prevailing logic whenever the question is brought up but it overlooks storing constants in interfaces and then NOT implementing them.For instance , I work with someone who uses this method all the time . I tend to use class with private constructors to hold my constants , but I 've started using interfaces in this manner to keep our code a consistent style . Are there any reasons to not use interfaces in the way I 've outlined above ? Essentially it 's a short hand that prevents you from having to make a class private , since an interface can not be initialized ."

Why ? Because in Java all logical operator ( & , & & , | , || , ^ ) got lower precedence than relational operators ( > , > = , < , < = , == , ! = ) . Same in Koltin but it looks like not for xor . So it goes this way : a > 0 gives boolean valueboolean xor b > 0 first evealuated to : boolean xor b not b > 0And finally we got compilation error that said : The integer literal does not conform to the expected type BooleanYou can check this situation here : XOR not working wellOne extra case : if you think that this one : a > 0 xor ( b > 0 ) works ... well , no .

He 's showing a `` poorly written '' shuffling code for online poker ( it has a few other bugs , which I 've removed because they are not related to my question ) This is how the algorithm works : It iterates all the cards once . At each iteration a random number is generated and the i-th card is swapped with the r-th card . Simple , right ? While I understand the algorithm , I did n't understand his probability calculation . He said that because Random uses a 32-bit seed ( or 64 , it does n't seem to matter ) , this is constrained to only 2^32 different permutations.He also said that Knuth 's algorithm is better ( same for loop , but choose a number between 1 and i ) because it gives you N ! permutations . I can agree with Knuth 's algorithm calculations . But I think that on the first one ( which is supposed to be the faulty one ) there should be N^N different permutations . Is Sedgewick wrong or am I missing a fact ?"
"I have been trying to think of a performance efficient way of finding the union of character occurrences in a set of fixed width strings grouped by index . Something like this ; Resulting in the following where each group of digits exists in all strings at char index n : I have thought of doing it the very naive way of iterating through every string , at every index while storing the intermediate strings in an array and then iterating through that array to build the output value .

"I 'm wondering if there 's ever a valid use case for the following : It seems to be a common pattern ( see Collections for a number of examples ) to accept a collection of type T , where T extends Comparable < ? super T > .But it seems technically impossible to fulfill the contract of compareTo ( ) when comparing to a base class , because there 's no way to ensure that another class does n't extend the base with a contradictory comparison . Consider the following example : We have two classes extending Base using comparisons that do n't follow a common rule ( if there were a common rule , it would almost certainly be implemented in Base ) . Yet the following broken sort will compile : Would n't it be safer to only accept T extends Comparable < T > ? Or is there some use case that would validate the wildcard ?"

"I just started using mock objects ( using Java 's mockito ) in my tests recently . Needless to say , they simplified the set-up part of the tests , and along with Dependency Injection , I would argue it made the code even more robust.However , I have found myself tripping in testing against implementation rather than specification . I ended up setting up expectations that I would argue that it 's not part of the tests . In more technical terms , I will be testing the interaction between SUT ( the class under test ) and its collaborators , and such dependency is n't part of contract or the interface of the class ! Consider that you have the following : When dealing with XML node , suppose that you have a method , attributeWithDefault ( ) that returns the attribute value of the node if it 's available , otherwise it would return a default value ! I would setup the test like the following : Well , here not only did I test that attributeWithDefault ( ) adheres to the specification , but I also tested the implementation , as I required it to use Element.getAttribute ( ) , instead of Element.getAttributeNode ( ) .getValue ( ) or Element.getAttributes ( ) .getNamedItem ( ) .getNodeValue ( ) , etc.I assume that I am going about it in the wrong way , so any tips on how I can improve my usage of mocks and best practices will be appreciated.EDIT : What 's wrong with the testI made the assumption above that the test is a bad style , here is my rationale.The specification does n't specify which method gets called . A client of the library should n't care of how attribute is retrieved for example , as long as it is done rightly . The implementor should have free reign to access any of the alternative approaches , in any way he sees fit ( with respect to performance , consistency , etc ) . It 's the specification of Element that ensures that all these approaches return identical values.It does n't make sense to re-factor Element into a single method interface with getElement ( ) ( Go is quite nice about this actually ) . For ease of use , a client of the method should be able to just to use the standard Element in the standard library . Having interfaces and new classes is just plain silly , IMHO , as it makes the client code ugly , and it 's not worth it.Assuming the spec stays as is and the test stays as is , a new developer may decide to refactor the code to use a different approach of using the state , and cause the test to fail ! Well , a test failing when the actual implementation adheres to the specification is valid.Having a collaborator expose state in multiple format is quite common . A specification and the test should n't depend on which particular approach is taken ; only the implementation should !"

"I can create a recursive closure : But of course , it has sense only as an example . To be useful , such collection should keep already once counted elements and get ( ) them without recounting . The counting of elements should happen in lazy way , at first need . Thus , no member will have to be calculated more than once . In such way we 'll a structure that will look like a recursively defined sequence , and will be fast and reusable . When I started to study Java 8 I thought that Stream works in that way . But it does not , for the stream can not be used twice.I thought about the following construction : But that way it wo n't work - I ca n't get an item from the stream by index.The other problem is that if I 'll later go along the stream , it will be consumed and I ca n't use it repeatedly . If I copy the stream to List , it is not lazy anymore.As a result , I need some construction that I can address by index . As fibo ( i ) . Edit .

"Note : I found multiple questions pointing out differences between javac and the Eclipse compiler , but as far as I could see all of them discuss other issues.Suppose we have this method : I found different behavior between javac and the Eclipse Java compiler when compiling calls to this method and I 'm not sure which of the two is right.A simple use of this method could be : The compiler should be able to bind T to Optional < String > using the first argument and U to String using the second . So this call should be valid ( in my opinion ) .This compiles fine using javac but fails to compile using Eclipse : Type mismatch : can not convert from void to < unknown > Adding a type argument to the first argument ( ( ) - > Optional. < String > of ( `` foo '' ) ) makes it compile in Eclipse too.Question : From a specification point of view , is Eclipse correct in rejecting this call ( and why ( not ) ) ? Now suppose we want to throw a custom ( runtime ) exception , if the Optional is empty : This is rejected by both , javac and the Eclipse compiler , but with different error messages : javac : `` unreported exception X ; must be caught or declared to be thrown '' Eclipse compiler : `` Type mismatch : can not convert from void to < unknown > '' When I add the type argument to the first argument as above , Eclipse succeeds in compiling while javac still fails . When I add < RuntimeException > as type argument to the second argument , it 's the other way around , Eclipse fails and javac succeeds.Question : Again , are the compilers right in rejecting this call and why ? In my opinion both variants should compile fine without additional hints by using type arguments . If so I 'll fill one bug report for javac ( regarding the `` unreported exception '' ) and one for the Eclipse compiler ( regarding the `` type mismatch '' ) . But first I want to be sure the specification shares my point of view.Versions used : javac : 1.8.0_66Eclipse JDT : 3.11.1.v20151118-1100EDIT : I filled bug 482781 for the issue in Eclipse.The issue with javac is already reported as JDK-8056983 , see Tunakis answer ."
"My other question got closed as a duplicate , so I 'll try this again . I have also read this question and what I 'm asking is different . I 'm interested in learning the internal implementation of how Call-by-Name : = > Type differs from ( ) = > Type .

"I have the following piece of code : Method unwrap ( ) just creates a list of T 's referenced by the weak references in slaves and as a side effect eliminates the weak references referencing null in slaves . Then comes the sort which relies on that each member of slaves references some T ; otherwise the code yields a NullPointerException.Since unwrapped holds a reference on each T in slaves , during sorting no GC eliminates a T. Finally , unwrapped = null eliminates the reference on unwrapped and so releases GC again . Seems to work quite well . Now my question : If I remove unwrapped = null ; this results in NullPointerExceptions when running many tests under some load . I suspect that the JIT eliminates List < T > unwrapped = unwrap ( ) ; and so GC applies to the T 's in slaves during sorting . Do you have another explanation ? If you agree with me , is this a bug in the JIT ? I personally think that unwrapped = null should not be necessary , because unwrapped is removed from the frame as soon as updateOrdering ( ) returns . Is there a specification what may be optimized and what is not ? Or did I do the thing in the wrong way ? I have the idea to modify comparator that it allows weak references on null . What do you think about that ? Thanks for suggestions . Add on ( 1 ) Now I want to add some missing pieces of information : First of all Java version : java version `` 1.7.0_45 '' OpenJDK Runtime Environment ( IcedTea 2.4.3 ) ( suse-8.28.3-x86_64 ) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM ( build 24.45-b08 , mixed mode ) Then someone wanted to see method unwrap Note that while iterating , void references are removed . In fact i replaced this method by using my own iterator but functionally this should be the same . Then someone wantet the stacktrace . Here is a piece of it . it points into the comparator , the line with the return . and finally , is an important constant . Add on ( 2 ) Observed now that indeed NPE occurs even if 'unwrapped = null ' is present in updateOrdering ( ) . Weak references may be removed by java runtime if no strict reference holds after jit optimization . The source code seems not important at all . I solved the problem the following way : without any decoration inserted to prevent slaves to be garbage collected and the comparator in CMP_IDX_SLV enabled to handle weak references to null : As a side effect , ordering the underlying list List > slaves ; puts the void weak references at the end of the list , where it can be collected later ."

"From the documentation of Files.isHidden ( Path ) ( emphasis mine ) : Tells whether or not a file is considered hidden . The exact definition of hidden is platform or provider dependent . On UNIX for example a file is considered to be hidden if its name begins with a period character ( '. ' ) . On Windows a file is considered hidden if it is n't a directory and the DOS hidden attribute is set . Depending on the implementation this method may require to access the file system to determine if the file is considered hidden.From this I can understand what the expected behavior is . However , why is this the expected behavior ? The reason I 'm wondering is because of the difference in behavior between Files.isHidden , DosFileAttributes.isHidden , and Windows ' File Explorer . For instance , I can go into File Explorer and set a directory to be hidden and it will no longer show up ( unless I configure it to show hidden items ) . If I test if said directory is hidden with Java then Files.isHidden returns false and DosFileAttributes.isHidden returns true . You can test this with the following code : Note : I 'm using Windows 10 and OpenJDK 11.0.1 . My file system is NTFS.Running this with : I get : Note : This behavior appears to be part of WindowsFileSystemProvider . The method Files.isHidden ( Path ) simply forwards the call to the argument 's FileSystem 's provider . The implementation is basically : I found this ( non ) -issue ( JDK-8170334 ) where a comment says : I do n't think we have a bug here because the hidden attribute is meaningless on directories.Yet File Explorer , which is core software on Windows , behaves like the hidden attribute is not meaningless on directories . So again , why does the Java implementation on Windows take into account whether or not the Path points to a directory ? Or is Java correct and File Explorer is doing non-standard things ? I 'm inclined to think File Explorer is correct because both CMD ( via dir ) and PowerShell ( via Get-ChildItem ) wo n't list hidden directories either ; not unless the appropriate options are specified ."

"I 'm parsing large PCAP files in Java using Kaitai-Struct . Whenever the file size exceeds Integer.MAX_VALUE bytes I face an IllegalArgumentException caused by the size limit of the underlying ByteBuffer.I have n't found references to this issue elsewhere , which leads me to believe that this is not a library limitation but a mistake in the way I 'm using it.Since the problem is caused by trying to map the whole file into the ByteBuffer I 'd think that the solution would be mapping only the first region of the file , and as the data is being consumed map again skipping the data already parsed.As this is done within the Kaitai Struct Runtime library it would mean to write my own class extending fom KatiaiStream and overwrite the auto-generated fromFile ( ... ) method , and this does n't really seem the right approach.The auto-generated method to parse from file for the PCAP class is.And the ByteBufferKaitaiStream provided by the Kaitai Struct Runtime library is backed by a ByteBuffer.Which in turn is limitted by the ByteBuffer max size.Am I missing some obvious workaround ?

"I am rewriting Jack Crenshaw 's `` let 's build a compiler '' from Turbo Pascal 4.0 to JAVA . This is motivating because the classic book does not have yet an O-O version Is there a more modern , OO version of `` Let 's Build a Compiler '' ? The book contains 15 chapters . The compiler is presented in an incremental manner : Chapter I provides the boilerplate codes for the whole compiler , then each chapter adds some lines to the Pascal procedures of the precedent chapter . I have already translated the first 2 chapters , each chapter as a package , each Pascal procedure as a static protected method in JAVA , the procedures of one chapter are gathered in a single class that extends the class translated from its precedent chapter . However , when I come to td3 , I have to update the factor ( ) of td2.Cradle , but I do not want to change in td2.Cradle the factor ( ) , because that will make the factor ( ) in td2 do more than it should have presented in td2 . I thought of `` extend '' td2.Cradle ( ) , however , it seems impossible to extend a static class . My related question hereMaybe should I change every static method to non-static one ? I certainly need some design pattern here , any one can help ? I hope I was clear . In summary , this project incrementally presents more and more instructions for each procedure and I do hope to record the intermediate steps using some JAVA mechanism like inheritance.The Pascal code is the classic book is here LBC . I feel attempted to use inheritance because Each chapter calls/adds a bit more lines to the procedures defined in precedent chaptersI hope to make my JAVA source code usable to everyone who wants to follow LBC step by step . So it is not appropriate to use a single class to put in the final source code of the author 's compiler . It is essential to split the codes by chapters and increment them gradually as Crenshaw did . My actual solution is to keep the methods of tp1.Cradle as static . The methods in tp2.Cradle , tp3.Cradle , ... , until tp15.Cradle will be non-static , and they all statically import tp1.Cradle . * . Furthermore , for every integer i greater than 2 , tp [ i ] .Cradle extends tp [ i-1 ] .Cradle . Do n't hesitate to tell me better solution ."

"My boss just told me that he learned about fast VB6 algorithms from a book and that the shortest way to write things is not necessarily the fastest ( e.g . builtin methods are sometimes way slower than selfwritten ones because they do all kinds of checking or unicode conversions which might not be necessary in your case ) .Now I wonder , is there a website with info on fast different constructs are in various languages , esp . Java/C # /Python/… ( also C++ but there are so many compilers which probably differ a lot ) .E.g . is there a difference betweenandAnother example : is a = a * 4 maybe compiled to the same code as a < < = 2 ?

"When I was working on a project of mine and had to use a lot of nested objects , I became very unsure of my design of structure in Java when I wanted to set an instance variable of a deeply nested object from the upper object . It feels like I miss a basic understanding perhaps of structured design in Java . Any insight in this is appreciated.Imagine I have an object which has a logical structure of having nested sub objects as variables . For example : If I now want to set a private String variable 'nameOfKing ' in King from the main object ( Country ) , I would have to define every method in all upper classes of King . So something like this : so that I can call country.setNameOfKing ( n ) ; . Now this is fine if you have just a few variables , but what if the classes King , Palace , Capital each have many other variables and methods defined and all of them have to be called from Country . What if Palace also contains other class objects like ( just making stuff up now ) ThroneRoom , Treasury , Queen , etc ... It would mean that for almost all methods in the sub classes , one has to exist in the Country class , which could potentially mean you have to create a huge amount of methods simply for passing info to the sub objects resulting in a very large Country class.Now I suppose you could technically say that King could also be defined in the Country itself , doing away with the extra methods in Palace and Capital , but it would still mean the methods have to exists in the Country class and what if this structure makes sense as in logic grouped together , what would be the best approach for this ? I 'm not sure there is a better way , but I ca n't shake the feeling I 'm missing something here ."

Generics was n't there until Java 1.5 , and the generic type is lost during runtime.I also know , there are some patterns for it . For example : My question is , why is n't it automatically done by the compiler ? For each class , where any generic type is present , the compiler could automatically add one ( or more , if I have more generic types ) parameter for each constructor , and bind those values to private fields . And each time , I write bar instanceof T it could compile this as clazzOfGenericT.isInstance ( bar ) .Is there any reason , this is not implemented ?

"So , given that I have an instance of this component : foo.cfcAnd , this other component , fooParent.cfc : Let 's say I create instances of `` foo '' a few different ways : As expected , this outputs : What I want to know is , what can I possibly do within foo.cfc that will tell me something ( anything ! ) about the context in which it is being invoked ?

Ultimately , some way of building foo.cfc so that something like this could be my output , from my sample snippet above : Where each of those values might be determined by inspecting the result from passing getMetaData the actual containing object reference.Update As suggested by Micah in the comments , I 've added the `` Java '' tag to this , since I suspect he could be correct in that the solution may lie in using Java for introspection.UpdateRather than leave this as what appears to be a purely-academic discussion , let me explain why I need this.I 'm using CFWheels ORM with includes to get back references to my data like so : This will return to me an object that I can reference like so : Now , within my `` AuthSource.authenticate '' method , I would like to know about the `` User '' object that I 'm contained within .

Now , what I want , is that USD currency in the left ListView would be drawn in red ( exact color does n't matter now , I will change it later to something meaningful ) AND , in the same time , bottom part of `` United States Dollar '' and top part of `` Afghan Afghani '' in the right ListView would be drawn also in the same red color.This color changing should be done in dynamic way - color should be changed only for the part of text that is under glass rectangle during scrolling of the list . *OK , EUR and USD here are special currencies drawn with not standard cyan color . The question is about at least text with white color . But if it will be possible to change also cyan color it would be great ."

"The following code compiles : But the following code produces six errors : Errors : It 's pretty clear that the compiler is n't recognizing the & being used for multiple generic bounds on Class . Are you not allowed multiple bounds on the type parameter for Class ? What am I supposed to do if I want an ArrayList of Classes that implement both Interface1 and Interface2 ? Motivation : The code I 'm working on at the moment has a lot of declarations like this : They map a string to a class which contains a 'method ' for doing a certain calculation . Each separate hashmap uses a different wildcard for the classes ( so ApproximativeMode might be replaced with ExactMode for the hashmap containing all of the exact methods ) . I 've just gone through all of the methods , making them implement a new interface , NamedMethod , which has a method that gets their full , displayed name ( e.g . `` Linear hydroxyadenine method '' ) . I now want to put all of the hashmaps into an ArrayList so that I can write an iterator that goes over the hashmaps and displays their full names . So I might end up with : Approximative Methodsvon Ahsen et al.Owen et al.etc.Exact MethodsSantalucia et al . LHMetc.etc.So my declaration of the ArrayList holding all the hashmaps is : Of course , none of the hashmaps are actually of that type , but I was hoping that I could add NamedMethod to the wildcard in each one and get an ArrayList of them all . Clearly that is n't possible . If this is n't clear , let me know and I 'll fix it up ."

"I am reading through AngelikaLangerParametrizedTypeWorkAround . I do understand manyof the concepts here , i do understand what is unbounded wild card parametrized type . Thoughquoting from the reference it states that : -In the case of the unbounded wildcard parameterized type we areadditionally restricted in how we can use the array elements , becausethe compiler prevents certain operations on the unbounded wildcardparameterized type . In essence , arrays of raw types and unboundedwildcard parameterized types are semantically very different from whatwe would express with an array of a concrete wildcard parameterizedtype . For this reason they are not a good workaround and onlyacceptable when the superior efficiency of arrays ( as compared tocollections ) is of paramount importance.I have two specific questions here.What is practical usage of unbounded wild-card parameterized type ? It 's clearly evident from the example , that you can add elements to the array but while retrieving , it issues a compiler error ? What does the article mean , when it states that , these wild-card parameterized are only acceptable when superior efficiency of arrays is of paramount importance ?

"As you know the 'program to an interface ' design principle broadly prefers supertypes instead of concrete types or implementations . Is it consistent with the principle to use instanceof in a Java program to derive a concrete type from a supertype ? In my application , Storehouse is an abstract supertype class with a couple of private variables and public getters and setters . ConcreteStorehouseA inherits from Storehouse and has a lot of concrete methods and variables . ConcreteStorehouseB is similar but different.My application receives a Storehouse . However , Storehouse is not a useful type to operate on . Because the only really useful methods are contained in the concrete types , I use instanceof as follows : Is using instanceof compatible with the principle ? Edit : In essence the application is a dice simulator for a table top RPG , Shadowrun . The concrete types are the different test types - Success Test , Opposed Test , Extended Test - which all have very different factors and parameters for their successful operation . The supertype essentially contains the dice pool !"

"I have been using a lot of defensive null checks within my Java code . Though they serve their purpose well ( most of the time ) , they come a with a huge trade off with 'ugly ' looking code.Does it really make sense to put these null checks in all the time ?

"I would like to understand the best approach to the following problem.I have documents really similar to resume/cv and I have to extract entities ( Name , Surname , Birthday , Cities , zipcode etc ) .To extract those entities I am combining different finders ( Regex , Dictionary etc ) There are no problems with those finders , but , I am looking for a method / algorithm or something like that to confirm the entities.With `` confirm '' I mean that I have to find specific term ( or entities ) in proximities ( closer to the entities I have found ) .Example : I can confirm the entity < name > because it is closer to specific term that let me understand the `` context '' . If i have `` name '' or `` surname '' words near the entity so i can say that i have found the < name > with a good probability.So the goal is write those kind of rules to confirm entities . Another example should be : My address is ... ... , 00143 RomeItalian zipcodes are 5 digits long ( numeric only ) , it is easy to find a 5 digits number inside my document ( i use regex as i wrote above ) , and i also check it by querying a database to understand if the number exists . The problem here is that i need one more check to confirm ( definitely ) it.I must see if that number is near the entity < city > , if yes , ok ... I have good probabilities.I also tried to train a model but i do not really have a `` context '' ( sentences ) .Training the model with : does not sound good to me because : I have read we need many sentences to train a good modelThose are not `` sentences '' i do not have a `` context '' ( remember where I said the document is similar to resume/cv ) Maybe those phrases are too shortI do not know how many different ways i could find to say the exact thing , but surely I can not find 15000 ways : ) What method should I use to try to confirm my entities ?

"I have recently been developing a game for android . The game is of a similar format to the classic Pokemon games ( quite complex ) . I have got quite far without any problems . However , I am finding it difficult to develop the dialogue ( typewriter text ) boxes that appear at the bottom of the screen when someone is talking . I am stuck on waiting for any input without blocking the render and update methods ( as they all run on the same thread ) .This is a simplified version of my game loop , outlining the structure and what I do each frame . The update method shown is called through the View # onDraw method.As you can see , these operations update all the game components ( map , battles , guis etc . ) and then renders them to the screen . By looking at the code , it 's clear that I 'm running these operations on the same thread , so this thread can obviously not be blocked ( otherwise the game will just stop ) .This is where my problem is . I use an in game gui with a few buttons . These buttons are assigned to 8 integers ( 0-8 ) and when the up button is pressed for example , that input data is passed through the game to the existing dialog or battle or whatever needs it . These buttons rely on the main activity 's touch events where the MotionEvent which , as a result of running the game loop off of the onDraw method , tuns on the same thread as the game itself . Here is how I handle dialogs : I use javascript ( rhino parser ) as follows ( passing a dialog object to the script in the variable 'dialog ' ) : var d = dialog.show ( `` Hello ! How are you . `` ) ; To get the input , I call the getInput method which takes in the dialog , and up to 4 strings as selection options . This method is supposed to return an integer value . This can be called through the script as follows : var response = dialog.getInput ( d , `` I 'm fine , thank you ! `` , `` Who wants to know . `` ) ; The getInput method is as follows in my Dialog class : Now my main question is how to run this method without blocking the render and update thread . More specifically setting the value of d.lastInput and d.waitingForInput when the user touches a certain region of the screen ( where the gui select button is ) .If there are any doubts about what I am trying to ask in this question , please leave a comment as I am quite tired and have spent some time trying to solve this.EDIT : I have thought about running the input on a separate thread but this will still lead to blocking other input methods from being called ( such as changing the selected option in the dialog ) ."

I fully admit my understand of streams is limited.The two approaches return the same data , so it is not a question of functionality per se .

"In a bidirectional mapping between entities ( e.g . @ ManyToOne ↔ @ OneToMany ) , the counterpart needs to be synchronized on every change , especially when using a 2nd level cache . This is usually done with helper methods . Those helper methods do not perform well if the Many part contains a lot of entries , because the whole set is fetched each time . A simple example would be an entity Store which has n Products , whereas n is very large . Adding a new Product to the Store would require the Store to fetch the whole list of Products to finally add it to the set ( see code example below ) .One could argue , that when modelling such a relation it would be better represented with an unidirectional association from the Product to the Store . We are using many JPQL queries in our application though . In JPQL , it comes very handy to join entities from both sides.Do you see any problems when mapping the @ OneToMany relation in the Store entity , when Many actually means many and not just a few , and just make the field private , without getters and setters , provided that the whole relation is lazily fetched ? As I understand , Hibernate just needs the field to map the relation . And if the set is private , no performance issues should occur ? The Product entity : The Store entity :"

"( Actually , this question is not directly related to lambdas , but to casts using bounds , so the question marked as duplicate does not provide an answer to this question .

"I am writing a simple top down space game , and am extending it to allow play over a network with multiple players . I 've done a fair bit of reading , but this is the first time I 've done this and I 'd appreciate some advice on choosing a sensible design.My GUI is written using Swing . 30 times a second , a timer fires , and repaints my GUI according to data in a gameWorld object in memory ( essentially a list of ships & projectiles with positions , etc ) . Physics updates of the gameWorld are also carried out using this timer . Thus , for the single player implementation , everything happens on the EDT , and this works fine.Now , I have separate thread dealing with incoming packets from other players . I would like to update the data in my gameWorld object based on what these packets contain . My question is , should I use invokeLater to make these changes , or should I use locks to avoid concurrency problems ? To illustrate what I mean : vsThe latter would also require using similar synchronize blocks wherever the EDT accesses the gameWorld , so it seems to me that using invokeLater would be simpler to implement . But am I right in thinking both approaches would work ? Are there any other significant pros/cons to bear in mind ? Thanks , Jeremy"

"I read in a C # introductory book that you should n't catch an exception if you do n't know what to do with it . Thinking of that bit of advice while programming in Java , I sometimes find I do not know what to do with an exception , but I am forced to catch it or `` percolate it up '' to avoid a compile error . I 'd rather not clutter methods with throws clauses all the way up the call tree so I have often resorted to `` converting '' the exception to a RuntimeException as in the following . Adding throws clauses to many methods for an exception that is n't really `` handled '' ( properly dealt with ) seems verbose and distracting . Is the following bad style and if so what is a better way to deal with this ? Edit : Aside from the clutter , there 's another problem with the percolating exceptions : after code revisions you probably end up with some unnecessary throws clauses . The only way I know to clean them out is by trial and error : remove them and see if the compiler complains . Obviously , this is annoying if you like to keep the code clean ."

"I got general understanding what volatile means in Java . But readingJava SE Specification 8.3.1.4 I have a problem understanding the text beneath that certain volatile example . This allows method one and method two to be executed concurrently , but guarantees that accesses to the shared values for i and j occur exactly as many times , and in exactly the same order , as they appear to occur during execution of the program text by each thread . Therefore , the shared value for j is never greater than that for i , because each update to i must be reflected in the shared value for i before the update to j occurs . It is possible , however , that any given invocation of method two might observe a value for j that is much greater than the value observed for i , because method one might be executed many times between the moment when method two fetches the value of i and the moment when method two fetches the value of j.How is j never greater than i , but at the same time any given invocation of method two might observe a value for j that is much greater than the value observed for i ? ? Looks like contradiction.I got j greater than i after running sample program . Why use volatile then ? It gives almost the same result without volatile ( also i can be greater than j , one of previous examples in specs ) . Why is this example here as an alternative to synchronized ?"

But at this moment , Outer class instance has not been fully created yet . So the anonymous class instance references an object with incomplete states , hence the issue.Is he right ? Thanks ."
"A colleague pointed me to a strange case in C # ( not so sure if this actually strange though ) . Suppose you have a class Employee . If you want to create a Generic List < > of type Employee , you can simply do : I understand that I need to pass the Employee type to the Generic list so that it knows the required type information about Employee and generates methods that return and accept parameters that are compatible with Employee . Now my question is , why is n't it possible to do the following ? Should n't this suffice the information required for List < > to know , in order to create a list ? In other words , the type of x which is the type of Employee is now passed as a generic type parameter to List < > , which ( as I used to believe ) is the same as passing list the type name ( in this case Employee ) . I know that something like this is available in Java ( using the .class ) keyword on a variable . I 'm sure I AM missing something , so please , enlight me guys !"

".NET has a function called GC.KeepAlive ( Object ) . Its sole purpose is to ensure the lifetime of the referenced object lasts until code flow reaches the call.This is normally not necessary unless one is interoperating with native code.I have a situation where I 've got a graph of C++ objects accessed via JNI , where certain root objects need to be kept alive to keep the children alive . Both the root objects and the child objects have mirrors in JVM land . If the root object is collected and freed on the C++ side ( by way of a SWIG-generated finalizer ) , however , the child objects will become invalid , since their C++ backing object will have been freed.This can be solved by ensuring the local variables that root the object graph have a lifetime that exceeds the last use of a child object . So I need an idiomatic function that does nothing to an object , yet wo n't be optimized away or moved ( e.g . hoisted out of a loop ) . That 's what GC.KeepAlive ( Object ) does in .NET.What is the approximate equivalent in Java ? PS : some possibly illustrative code : The trouble is that the GC freeing Parent p will free the memory allocated for Child while doStuff is executing . GC has been observed to do this in practice . A potential fix if GC.KeepAlive was available : I could e.g . call toString on p , but I wo n't be doing anything with its output . I could poke p into an array temporarily , but how do I know the JVM wo n't discard the store ? Etc ."

Many people say they are using factory pattern in their project . But when i actually see their implementation it looks totally differentfrom definition what i have read in head first book . In the book they have described two kind of factory pattern i.e Factory Method : - A class specifies its sub-classes to specify which objects to create based on some parameter . So we expect here some abstract method in base class whihich will be implemented by child class and pupose of that will be to create some object Abstract Factory : - Provides an factory ( in form of interface or abstract factory ) for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.I have a question here on what do they mean by family of dependent or relatedobjects . Lets refer to http : //www.apwebco.com/gofpatterns/creational/AbstractFactory.html . As per my understanding it means that in FinancialToolsFactory ( in the link ) is able to create TaxProcessor which is a family of products where actuall concreate products are CanadaTaxProcessor and EuropeTaxProcessor . So here we will have n number of concrete factories ( in this case CanadaFinancialToolsFactory and EuropeFinancialToolsFactory ) which will be extending/implementing abstract factory in this case FinancialToolsFactory.Please let me know if above understanding is correct as i think its the crux of Factory pattern.Second question : What people are doing on the name of factory pattern is below : They are just passing class like Example.class from main method and getting the object instance for that specific class.Now if we go by actual concept of factory pattern which is described in beginning ( from head first book ) and other websites it does not follow any of the two factory patterns . To me it looks like a utility class where we are passing the class and getting the object instance . Please let me know if you folks agree with this ?

"I am trying to embed a lua-based script system into my game engine.I would like the scripting to be able to have both blocking and non-blocking commands , for example : Since the `` walkTo '' needs to be `` active '' for more than 1 frame of execution , I would like to be able to run 1 statement at time from the Java host instead of the whole function . This is because it would be overkill to have real multithreading , which is not needed.If I could execute just 1 statement , and keep the execution state `` paused '' until next statement execution , I would be able to implement blocking commands like `` walkTo '' by checking if the command is finished in the host , and if it is , go on to the next statement , otherwise , wait until the next frame iteration.Is there any way to execute 1 statement a time from the Java host with LuaJ ( or with any other Lua api ) , or am I forced to develop my own script engine with lex and yacc ?

"I 've been exploring transforming an object from one type of class to another with java 8 . What I have are a bunch of xjc generated jaxb classes .

"Maybe the C++ and Java people can help me to define this problem I 'm going to explain . I have a problem in Ada ( you do n't need to know it , I 'm just interested in the concept ) on how representing a Constructor of a class which implements three main branches of dynamic identifiers : Pure number values ( int , float , String , whatever ) List/stack itemSomething what in C++ is likely a thread ( in Ada we have a more wide concept of this , related to a task , but we can concept a simple task as a thread , so the concept applies too ) I 'm gon na call this class Par_Class , and be any constructed object call Par_Obj . Thus , when an object Par_Obj is created ( so , the number values are initialized , the lists/stacks have other lists/stacks allocated or null and the memory range for the thread execution is reserved ) , the OS automatically starts the execution of the new thread in parallel with my main application ( and now they contend for system resources ) . But to simplify the example , let 's suppose I 'd have a class with an integer and a pointer to a string.In C++ , I could code , for example , ( please correct me if I 'm doing wrong ) the constructor could be implemented as and finally we could instantiate this class withand sure this constructor method belongs to the class Par_Class and not to any other class.Similarly , in Java , we could codeand we could instantiate the object using ( again please correct me if I 'm wrong ) . Again , Par_Class constructor is a method of the class Par_Class.In Ada 2005 , this class could be coded as and the user could callAnd that 's where resides the problem . The compiler says me that I could not use the method Construct in Par_Obj : = Par_Obj.Construct because yet my object is null . But it 's so obvious , because just what I want to do is to initialize the object ( so it would not be null anymore ) . There are other ways of constructing the object , for example , using a function from outside the class , but I do n't want to use this approach because it runs away from architecture . Could you please help me to formulate the problem to my Ada friends so they can help me to implement it in Ada ? I guess I 'm having a bit difficult on explaining this in general concept terms .

Also , could the package where the class is declared act as a friend or as a static function ? `` UpdateGot some more good reasons on why implementing it as suggested by @ SimonWright and some people from comp.lang.ada forum : So I asked : In this case function Construct would behave as a C++ static function ( or maybe a friend one ? ) ? And Dmitry Kazakov answered : That depends on what you mean . In Ada : there is no hidden parameters an operation can be dispatching ( virtual ) in any combination of parameters and/or result . But an operation can not be dispatching in more than one type ( no multiple dispatch ) . All tags of dispatching parameters must be same ( no multi-methods ) . there is no static or friend operations as the visibility rules are based on packages . The function Construct above is a primitive operation , it is not a constructor . Constructors in Ada are implicit , they consist of construction of the components ( in an unspecified order , recursively ) ; a call to Initialize if the type is a descendant of Ada.Finalization. [ Limited_ ] Controlled . ( Overridden bodies of Initialize are not called ! I.e . Ada constructors do not traverse derivation path . In short , aggregation is safe , derivation is not ; starting all task components . ( Note , tasks are not running when Initialize is called ! ) Destructors act in the reverse order : tasks - Finalize - components.And I guess it responds . Thank you people ."
"I am about to give a presentation in my company ( I am a trainee ) about Inheritance in Java.I think I figured it out and I also know how to use it . But one thing is not so sure.Where are the methodes stored in the storage . And how does an object know where the methodes are ? For example : We have this class.and this class : we now make an Object of the Dog class : Dog dog = new Dog ( ) ; So now my questions : The classes are loaded in the heap . So Dog and Animal are in the heap . ( EDIT : Thats wrong , classes do n't get loaded in the heap , look answers below . ) .So , Lets say we make dog.bark ( ) . How does dog know where the bark method is in the Heap ? Knows it where the Dog class is ? Next we make dog.eat ( ) : So when dog knows where Dog is , does Dog know where Animal is or does dog know where Animal is ? With know I mean it has a address where it is on the heap.And how is it when I overwrite a method ? Where is that stored ? thx for helping ."

"I was playing around with different implementations of the Euclidean distance metric and I noticed that I get different results for Scipy , pure Python , and Java.Here 's how I compute the distance using Scipy ( = option 1 ) : here 's an implementation in Python I found in a forum ( option 2 ) : and lastly , here 's my implementation in Java ( option 3 ) : Both sample and training_vector are 1-D arrays with length 784 , taken from the MNIST dataset . I tried all three methods with the same sample and training_vector . The problem is that the three different methods result in three significantly different distances ( that is , around 1936 for option 1 , 1914 for option 2 , and 1382 for option 3 ) . Interestingly , when I use the same argument order for sample and training_vector in options 1 and 2 ( i.e . flip the arguments to option 1 around ) , I get the same result for these two options . But distance metrics are supposed to be symmetrical , right ... ? What 's also interesting : I 'm using these metrics for a k-NN classifier for the MNIST dataset . My Java implementation yields an accuracy of around 94 % for 100 test samples and 2700 training samples . However , the Python implementation using option 1 only yields an accuracy of about 75 % ...

OK , in the last question , static methods from a class were used.But now this is different : System.out is a static field of System , yes ; it is also a PrintStream , and a PrintStream has a println ( ) method which happens to match the signature of a Consumer in this case , and a Consumer is what forEach ( ) expects.So I tried this ...

"I implemented a GapBuffer list in Java , and I ca n't figure out why it 's getting such a performance penalty . Similar code written in C # behaves as expected : inserting to the middle of the list is much faster than C # 's implementation of List .

However , when inserting and removing at a random spot in the list , the gap buffer has a strange performance penalty that I ca n't explain . Even stranger is the fact that removing items from the GapBufferList is slower than adding items to it - according to every test I 've run so far , it takes about three times longer to remove an item than it does to add one , despite the fact that their code is almost identical : The code for the gap buffer can be found at here , and the code for the benchmark entrypoint can be found here .

I wish to instantiate as followsso I still have access to common method such as openDoor ( ) , startEngine ( ) etc . How do I designed such a solution ? To clarify my two initial solutions , neither of which I am happy with are : Have dummy methods foldRoof ( ) , turboMode ( ) , foldFrontSeats ( ) which I override in ConvertibleVehicle only , leaving them to do nothing in other subclassesHave abstract methods foldRoof ( ) , turboMode ( ) , foldFrontSeats ( ) and force each subclass to provide an implementation even if it will be blank in all instances other than ConvertibleVehicleThe above seem slightly convoluted since they both pollute the base class as I add an increasing number of subclasses each with their own unique functionsAfter reading some of the responses perhaps there is some type of fundamental flaw in my design . Suppose I have a class VehicleFleet which takes vehicles and instructs them to drive as follows : Suppose this works for dozens of subclasses of Vehicle but for ConvertibleVehicle I also want to fold the roof before driving . To do so I subclass VehicleFleet as follows : This leaves me with a messy function foldRoof ( ) stuck in the base class where it does n't really belong which is overridden only in the case of ConvertibleVehicle and does nothing in all the other cases .

"I 'm writing software that requires timestamps in microsecond resolution or better.I 'm planning on using System.currentTimeMillis in combination with System.nanoTime sort of like this , though it 's just a rough code sketch : The documentation for nanoTime says : This method provides nanosecond precision , but not necessarily nanosecond resolution ( that is , how frequently the value changes ) - no guarantees are made except that the resolution is at least as good as that of currentTimeMillis ( ) .so it has n't given us a guarantee of a resolution any better than milliseconds.Going a little deeper , under the hood of nanoTime ( which is predictably a native method ) : Windows uses the QueryPerformanceCounter API which promises aresolution of less than one microsecond which is great.Linux uses clock_gettime with a flag to ensure the value ismonotonic but makes no promises about resolution.Solaris is similar to LinuxThe source does n't mention how OSX or Unix-based OSs deal with this . ( source ) I 've seen a couple of vague allusions to the fact it will `` usually '' have microsecond resolution , such as this answer on another question : On most systems the three least-significant digits will always be zero .

EDIT : If I create a single instance of progressbar when the label provider is created and then pass it to the tableeditor it will update the progressbar for the last element on which I say editor.setEditor ( bar , tableItem , 4 ) ; but I need to display a progressbar for each item and update it for each item !"

But in an attempt solve the issue ( and remove need for CallerRunPolicy to be called because queue full ) I increased queue size to 1000 and this caused the error to occur more quickly and then removed the limit completely and continue to fail more rapidlyI was looking at an alternative to ThreadExecutorPool and came across ForkJoinPool - https : //docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.htmlOne thing I noticed is that ForkJoinPool has different methods for submitting tasks from within a task submitted to ForkJoinPool compared to submitting form outside .

"I am getting a strange behavior , and I guess I 'm more looking for an explanation than a solution ( although solution is welcome as well ! ) .Here 's the code : And on some occasions , I am getting error logs with : java.lang.ClassCastException : can not be cast to android.content.pm.PackageInfo reported for line : The odd part is that , normally , ClassCastException usually look like ( AFAIK ) : java.lang.ClassCastException : foo.bar.ClassA can not be cast to foo.bar.ClassBHowever , the error I 'm seeing is showing blank for the first part.I decided to research a bit , and read something along the lines of it might happen if the function that 's returning the list internally casted the wrong object list and returned it or something . So I looked : ApplicationPackageManager.getInstalledPackages ( ) Ok , so the list that 's being returned is populated from ParceledListSlice.populateList ( ) ... ParceledListSlice.populateList ( ) So the item is being created from PackageInfo.CREATOR.createFromParcel ( ) ... And finally the creator.createFromParcel of PackageInfoSo everything seems to be ok . It 's creating a ParceledListSlice of type PackageInfo , and so in populateList it 's creating a PackageInfo item and putting it into a List of PackageInfo , which is the returned list . All the types/classes seem fine to me.So my questions , how would the above ClassCastException happen ? Why would it show `` blank '' type for the error message ? And what would be a possible solution ? I was thinking of just getting the list as a list of Object and checking `` instanceof '' , but I do n't think that 's gon na work either because it 'll probably end up saying ClassCastException : can not be cast into java.lang.Object '' or something.Any insights and explanations on how this could happen would be greatly appreciated .

"I have the following code : Note that class Generic is declared with a generic type parameter , but the variable generic in method main is of the erasure type , i. e. without a type parameter .

"In the system , I have an object - let 's call it TaskProcessor . It holds queue of tasks , which are executed by some pool of threads ( ExecutorService + PriorityBlockingQueue ) The result of each task is saved in the database under some unique identifier.The user , who knows this unique identifier , may check the result of this task . The result could be in the database , but also the task could still wait in the queue for execution . In that case , UserThread should wait until the task will be finished.Additionally , the following assumptions are valid : Someone else could enqueue the task to TaskProcessor and some random UserThread can access the result if he knows the unique identifier.UserThread and TaskProcess are in the same app . TaskProcessor contains a pool of threads , and UserThread is simply servlet Thread.UserThread should be blocked when asking for the result , and the result is not completed yet . UserThread should be unblocked immediately after TaskProcessor complete task ( or tasks ) grouped by a unique identifierMy first attempt ( the naive one ) , was to check the result in the loop and sleep for some time : But I do n't like it . First of all , I am wasting database connections . Moreover , if the task would be finished right after sleep , then the user will wait even if the result just appeared.Next attempt was based on wait/notify : But I do n't like it either . If more UserThreads will use TaskProcessor , then they will be wakened up unnecessarily every time some task would be completed and moreover - they will make unnecessary database calls.The last attempt was based on something which I called waitingRoom : But it seems to be not secure . Between database check and wait ( ) , the task could be completed ( notify ( ) would n't be effective because UserThread did n't invoke wait ( ) yet ) , which may end up with deadlock.It seems , that I should synchronize it somewhere .

"Today , some other developer found an XML schema with some interesting nesting , which JAXB compiled into a structure like this : If you try to compile this , the Java compiler says , with of course , the underline on the innermost class Choice declaration.But I say , class Choices.Choice is not what it was trying to declare . Rather , it was trying to declare Choices.Choice.Choice , which would be a different class.Interestingly , this is fine : But this is banned : So I guess the rule is that the name of a class ca n't be the same as a containing class at any level . Obviously the fix here is already known- get JAXB not to generate invalid code.But my question is , why is this restriction even present ?

"I have a very strange problem I developed my application using my HTC One V running 4.0.3 OS . Now the application works superb on mine and few other random 2.2 and 2.3 and 4+ devices but on some devices despite them having GooglePlayStore on them the application starts and it loads but does not show the map on other despite them having GPStore on them the application crashes saying GPStore/Service is not present . I tried to test the application on AVD Devies but none of them have GooglePlayStore installed . I tried Google Play on Android 4.0 emulator approach to push GPStore on to them but no success . My droid SDK is fully updated : I compile my application withIn my main activity I check if Google Play Service/Store is present to determine if GoogleMaps can be used : The method that checks the state of GooglePlay Service is located in my Services.java bellow : And my map is simply handled in my MapAgent class nothing impressive just handling markers . I 'm out of all ideas I ca n't get GooglePlay Service running on AVD 2.2+ I tried AVD 4.4 Google Play API it comes GPService but ti wont display the map . So to directly point out my sub questions : 1 ) If all AVD 's from 2.2 up to 4.4 are all without working GooglePlay Services then how can we test application for multiple phones and OS versions without having multiple phones . 2 ) Is there a sure way or a more proper way to display GoogleMap on older devices I 'm talking Android 2.2+ I used the most trivial way to display my map I have a SupportMap Fragment element in my Layout xml . The problem I 'm experiencing is that some 2.2 and 2.3 phones that have GooglePlayStore on them will or wont open the application those that do open the application do not display the map but they do display the map zoom controls and Google logo at the bottom.3 ) I added my layout file but I do not have my android phone anymore and AVD does not let me test application that require GooglePlayServices is it possible that my layout displayed bellow is causing the problem due to overlay layout.I basically have a frame layout in the background I have GoogleMap and on top of that in top corner I have a spinner and a button . When I last tested this application it worked on my phone HTC One V Android 4.0.3.EASIEST SOLUTION : To all friends who come across this issue of not being able to fully test your applications via AVD make the switch to Genymotion Emulator it is a life saver .

All of them reside within the same level into their respective resources folders , so when files get merged together , the later ones seem to overwrite the ones that have been added before .

I 'm wondering if the default implementation of Java 's Hashtable # hashCode ( ) is broken when the Hashtable contains only entries with identical keys and values per pair.See for example the following application : The hash code for an empty Hashtable is 0 . After an entry with the key `` Test '' and value `` Test '' has been added to the Hastable the hash code still is 0.The problem is that in Hashtable 's hashCode ( ) method the hash code of every entry is calculated and added to the hash code as followsHowever XOR on identical hash codes ( which is the case for identical Strings ) is always 0 . So entries with identical keys and values are not part of the Hashtable 's hash code.This implementation is imho broken because the Hashtable actually has changed . It should n't matter if key and value are identical .

"I am reading about classes in Python ( 3.4 ) and from what I understand it seems that every new object has its own bound methods instances.The output of this is False.This seems to me as a waste of memory . I thought that internally a.foo and b.foo would point somehow internally to one function in memory : A.foo where self as the class instance will be passed . I assume this maybe can not be implemented easily in the language.Does each new instance contain also new instances of its bound methods ? If so , does not this hurt the performance or make case for creating new objects more cautiously than in other languages where methods are `` shared '' among objects like in Java ?"
"I 've been asking questions on hex and bitwise manipulation ( here and elsewhere ) for the past week trying to wrap my head around their representation in Java . After much Googling and chagrin I must ask one final time how to perform logical arithmetic on bits that ought to be unsigned , but are represented as signed in Java.Okay : I am porting a C # program to Java . The program deals with bitmap manipulation , and as such much of the data in the app is represented as byte , an unsigned 8-bit integer . There are many suggestions to instead use the short data type in Java in order to `` mimic '' as close as possible the unsigned 8-byte integer.I do n't believe that 's possible for me as the C # code is performing various many shifting and AND operations with my byte data . For example , if data is a byte array , and this block of code exists in C # : It 's not a simple matter of just casting data as a short and being done with it to get it to work in Java . As far as the logic is concerned the requirement that my data stay in 8-bit unsigned is significant ; 16-bit unsigned would screw math like the above up . Am I right here ? Indeed , after having previously `` fake casting '' byte with 0XFF and char in Java and not getting the right results , I am afraid I hit a dead end.Now , in another part of the code , I am performing some bitmap pixel manipulation . Since it 's a long running process , I decided to make a call to native code through JNI . I realized recently that in there I could use the uint8_t data type and get the closest representation to the C # byte data type.Is the solution to make all my data-dependent functionality operate in JNI ? That seems highly inefficient , both to rewrote and to perform . Is the solution to redo the math in Java so the logic remains the same ? That seems right , but has the potential to induce an aneurysm , not to mention faulty math.I appreciate any and all suggestions ."

"I checked out official Android documentation for LRUCache which says : Each time a value is accessed , it is moved to the head of a queue . When a value is added to a full cache , the value at the end of that queue is evicted and may become eligible for garbage collection . I suppose this is the doubly linked list which is maintained by linkedhashmap which is used by the cache . To check this behavior , I checked out the source code for LruCache , and checked the get ( K key ) method . It further calls upon map 's get method which gets the value from the underlying hashmap and calls upon recordAccess method.recordAccess method in turn moves the accessed entry to the end of the list in case accessOrder is set to true ( for my problem let 's assume it is ) , else it does nothing . This sounds contradictory to the above statement where it 's said that the element is moved to the head of the queue . Instead it 's moved to the last element of the list ( using head.before ) .

"I have been trying to find clear contract from official Java documentation as to in which order Java streams , once a terminal operation is called , process the elements and call intermediate operations.For example lets look at these examples that use both Java stream version and plain iteration version ( both producing same outcome ) .Example1 : Will the Java stream in findFirstUsingStreams method after findFirst is called run map1 in the order described in findFirstUsingLoopV1 ( map is not run for all elements ) or as described in findFirstUsingLoopV2 ( map is run for all elements ) ? And will that order change in future versions of Java or there is an official documentation that guarantees us the order of map1 calls ? Example2 : Again will the Java stream in collectUsingStreams method after collect is called run f1 and f2 in the order described in collectUsingLoopV1 ( f1 is evaluated before f2 ) or as described in collectUsingLoopV2 ( f2 is evaluated before f1 ) ?

EditThanks for all the answers and comment but unfortunately I still dont see good explanation on the ordering of processing the elements . The docs do say that the encounter order will be preserved for lists but they dont specify how those elements will be processed . For example in case of findFirst the docs guarantees that map1 will first see 1 then 2 but it does not say that map1 wont be executed for 4 and 5 . Does it mean that we cant guarantee that our order of processing will be as we expect the in fure versions of Java ? Probably yes ."

Another option would be to defineand then check the classes for each argument , but I consider this not very elegant .

Also I created a public path ArrayList , where I intend to collect the path.Addittionally here are the Edge.java and the Node.java classes . Node.java : Edge.javaI know it looks like a homework .

"I only have about half a year of java experience , so please excuse my lack of knowledge . I tried doing some google searches , and I have some ideas on this , there are just a few holes that I need to fill in.I am trying to create a 'Dynamic Factory ' for a program I am doing . The basis of this is that I want people to be able to insert class files into a folder , and they will be loaded into my factory to create new instances of them later.This is what I have right now : Now what I am trying to figure out is how to get all the classes inside of a folder , make sure that they extend Kit , and then insert them into the Map to have instances of them created later . This is where I am stuck , I can not think of a good way to have the classes loaded into the map without having the class names and lookup strings identified somewhere in a config . The idea that I had was to have static code inside each class that would insert itself into the HashMap , but I am not exactly sure how that would work . All I am really asking for is an idea on how to go about accomplishing my goal . ( Having a folder that users can input classes into ( that extend Kit ) , and then have those classes dynamically load into my kitMap when my program is loaded )"
"I found a lot of posts on static initialization blocks , however I 'm trying to get a little better picture about the execution order and the reason for it . The code below prints out the text in both the static blocks and `` then '' prints out the text in the main static block . I understand the way the compiler calls this is to do all the static blocks in order when the class is loaded and then access the main method . But since the main method itself is static , why not execute that in order of the other static blocks ( Not even sure if its useful , just trying to understand a concept and if there 's a pressing reason for it being done this way ) . What if there 's static block we want to run after the main block ? Actual OutputWhy not ?"
"I 'm trying to implement a basic class to create , read , update and delete objects . I 'm sure I could find a library to do that but I 'm doing it myself for educational purposes .

Then , I have my EntityPersistor which is supposed to save entity from their content ( using serialization ) and name them from their key . My only implementation of this persistor for now is saving them on the disk . It is using the identifier as the name of the file to save it into.Here 's my entity persistor : So , the problem is I have to redefine the type for the key twice when I want to use it .

"Some Guava internal types , like AbstractMultiset , have a pattern like this : The idea is to delay creating the collection views ( elementSet ( ) , entrySet ( ) ) until they 're actually needed . There 's no locking around the process because if two threads call elementSet ( ) at the same time , it 's okay to return two different values . There will be a race to write the elementSet field , but since writes to reference fields are always atomic in Java , it does n't matter who wins the race.However , I worry about what the Java memory model says about inlining here . If createElementSet ( ) and ElementSet 's constructor both get inlined , it seems like we could get something like this : This would allow another thread to observe a non-null , but incompletely initialized value for elementSet . Is there a reason that ca n't happen ? From my reading of JLS 17.5 , it seems like other threads are only guaranteed to see correct values for final fields in elementSet , but since ElementSet ultimately derives from AbstractSet , I do n't think there 's a guarantee that all its fields are final ."
"The task I had to make has already been delivered , yet a certain question hangs around in my mind .

I 've taken this approach from Backbone ( Javascript ) . However , there are other methods that I liked to impose as class methods ( static ) on the Pojo class itself .

"I 'm using a ScheduledExecutorService and submitting a task like that : However a certain event might occur after indefinite amount of time , which signals that this task is no longer needed . And so I need to cancel this task , and I am using boolean cancelled = future.cancel ( false ) line .

And here lets first jump into Oracle Documentation and read what cancelled flag means : https : //docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html # cancel ( boolean ) Returns : false if the task could not be cancelled , typically because it has already completed normally ; true otherwiseThat 's all it says about the return value .

"Causality in JMM seems to be the most confusing part of it . I have a few questions regarding JMM causality , and allowed behaviors in concurrent programs.As I understand , the current JMM always prohibits causality loops . ( Am I right ? ) Now , as per the JSR-133 document , page 24 , Fig.16 , we have an example where : Initially x = y = 0Thread 1 : Thread 2 : Intuitively , r1 = r2 = r3 = 42 seems impossible . However , it is not only mentioned as possible , but also 'allowed ' in JMM.For the possibility , the explanation from the document which I fail to understand is : A compiler could determine that the only values ever assigned to x are 0 and 42 . From that , the compiler could deduce that , at the point where we execute r1 = x , either we had just performed a write of 42 to x , or we had just read x and seen the value 42 . In either case , it would be legal for a read of x to see the value 42 . It could then change r1 = x to r1 = 42 ; this would allow y = r1 to be transformed to y = 42 and performed earlier , resulting in the behavior in question . In this case , the write to y is committed first.My question is , what kind of compiler optimization is it really ? ( I am compiler-ignorant . ) Since 42 is written only conditionally , when the if statement is satisfied , how can the compiler decide to go with the writing of x ? Secondly , even if compiler does this speculative optimization , and commits y = 42 andthen finally makes r3 = 42 , is n't it a violation of causality loop , since there is no cause and effect distinction left now ? In fact there is one example in the same document ( page 15 , Figure 7 ) where a similar causal loop is mentioned as unacceptable . So how come this execution order is legal in JMM ?"

"Let 's say we have some code such as the following : ( Yes , I know a far better implementation would use a StringBuilder , but bear with me . ) Trivially , we might expect the bytecode produced to be something akin to the following : However , instead the compiler tries to be a bit smarter - rather than using the concat method , it has a baked in optimisation to use StringBuilder objects instead , so we get the following : However , this seems rather counter-productive to me - instead of using one string builder for the entire loop , one is created for each single concatenation operation , making it equivalent to the following : So now instead of the original trivial bad approach of just creating lots of string objects and throwing them away , the compiler has produced an far worse approach of creating lots of String objects , lots of StringBuilder objects , calling more methods , and still throwing them all away to generate the same output as without this optimisation.So the question has to be - why ? I understand that in cases like this : ... the compiler will create just one StringBuilder object for all three strings , so there are cases where the optimisation is useful . However , examing the bytecode reveals that even separating the above case to the following : ... means that we 're back with the case that three StringBuilder objects are individually created . I 'd understand if these were odd corner cases , but appending to strings in this way ( and in a loop ) are really rather common operations.Surely it would be trivial to determine , at compile time , if a compiler-generated StringBuilder only ever appended one value - and if this was the case , use a simple concat operation instead ? This is all with 8u5 ( however , it goes back to at least Java 5 , probably before . ) FWIW , my benchmarks ( unsurprisingly ) put the manual concat ( ) approach 2x3 times faster than using += in a loop with 10,000 elements . Of course , using a manual StringBuilder is always the preferable approach , but surely the compiler should n't adversely affect the performance of the += approach either ?"

"The problem I am facing is when I have an input ( TextField , TextArea , etc . ) and I am trying to insert some Greek words which contain accented characters .

"I 'm looking at some Java classes that have the following form : My usage of `` Comparable '' here is just to illustrate a possible use of the generic parameter `` E '' .

"I am trying to make a function graphing program in Java , and it involves taking a user 's input for the function which will be graphed , parsing it , and graphing it . For example , the user might enter in x^2 - y^2 , cos ( x + y ) , log ( x ) - sqrt ( y ) , etc . The program makes use of both infix binary operations ( + , - , etc . ) and unary operations ( cos , sqrt , etc. ) . In short , in order to evaluate the unary operations , I must make sure that a given expression follows the format of a single unary operation . For example , cos ( x ) , sqrt ( x + y ) , and log ( exp ( y ) - x ) all fit this format , since they are unary operations with some expression as their operand ; however , strings such as sin ( x ) *cos ( y ) and 1 + log ( x ) do not follow this format . In order to check , I made a regular expression for this format : ( this is just a regex to check if a given string is a name for a predefined unary operation ) I 'll give an explanation . This regex is looking for the name of one of the unary operations . After that , it looks for a left-parenthesis . After that , it looks for some sequence of characters which are not parentheses , and then some sequence which begins with a left parenthesis and ends with a right parenthesis . The latter prevents a String such as `` sin ( x ) + cos ( y ) '' from matching . This regular expression always gives desired results , as far as I can tell . However , in its use , one problem arises . Consider this situation : Obviously , if the regex works , this should return false , which it does . The same would be true with this example : Nothing really changed , pattern-wise . However , successively adding zeroes to the 3 , the match seems to take exponentially longer to evaluate . For me , 12 zeroes takes about 13 seconds . Since my program will be plotting many points on a graph , it will have to calculate thousands of expressions every time it graphs something , so this is a fatal flaw . I 've already found a way around having to use this regular expression and my program works quite nicely , but I would still like to know : why does this regular expression take so long to work for large inputs , and is there any way to change the regex to fix this issue ?"

I tested it ant it seems to work for the first 4 levels , but then either the lines become too small to accurately represent or there 's something wrong with my code because the breaks between the lines seem to become arbitrary . Was hoping somebody could test my code and see if they could find what the problem is . The following image is of depth 10.EDIT : fixed a part of code , still need help though"
"Say , I have a method : And then when trying to compile this code : I get an error Type mismatch : can not convert from Collection < Object > to Collection < Integer > .Could anyone explain why the type system can not infer that Collections.emptyList ( ) should be of type Collection < Integer > ?

"In an interview , I was given the following problem to solve initially using pen/paper , then via a program to verify the result.The question is as follows : There are three people A , B and C. Each person is capable of hitting a target with a probability of 6/7 , 4/5 and 3/4 respectively . What is the probability that if they were to each fire one shot that exactly two of them will hit the target ? The answer is : Below is my solution to the problem : The problem is as follows , regardless of how large a number of trials I run , the probability flat-lines at around roughly 0.3857002101 . Is there something wrong in the code ? The interviewer said it is trivial to get the result to converge to around 9 decimal place accuracy within 1 million trials , regardless of the seed.Any ideas on where the bug is in my code ? UPDATE 1 : I 've tried the above code with the following generators , they all seem to platau at around the same time roughly trial 10^9 . std : :mt19937_64 std : :ranlux48_base std : :minstd_rand0UPDATE 2 : Thinking about the problem , I 've gone down the following track . The ratio 27/70 comprised of 27 and 70 which are both coprime and where factors of 70 under 4x10^9 is roughly 57x10^6 or about 1.4 % of all the numbers . Hence the probability of getting the `` exact '' ratio of 27/70 out of two numbers selected at random between [ 0,4x10^9 ] is roughly 1.4 % ( as there are more factors of 27 within 4x10^9 ) - So getting the exact ratio is very low , and that number will be constant regardless of the number of trials.Now if one where to talk about thick bounds - ie : numbers in the range of factors of 70 +/5 , that increases the probability of choosing a pair of numbers at random within the range [ 0,4x10^9 ] that would give a ratio within specified/related tolerance to about roughly 14 % , but with this technique the best we can get will be on average roughly 5 decimal places accurate when compared to the exact value . Is this way of reasoning correct ?"
"I 've ran into a bit of a confusion.I know that String objects are immutable . This means that if I call a method from the String class , like replace ( ) then the original contents of the String are not altered . Instead , a new String is returned based on the original .

"I have a question regarding floating point arithmetic in java and its precision . I did do my research on here and via google and come across some solutions but am having difficulties implementing them in my design . So in Java I am making use of the BigDecimal class in getting my calculations accurate . Note that the variables are double and the values can have a precision up to 8 decimal places to the right when doing calculations . The result ( precision ) to display is known and thats what I 'll be storing as the current value . Also , all values come in dynamically ( through a method ) . The argument passed should be the currentValue + the step size . } Now , it works with some values but not all . Especially when I mess with the step size . So if step = 0.1 it was fine . If I made it 0.005 , I 'd get an AirthmeticException - non terminating decimal expansion on the step whereWhen .005 is set for the step variable , after making a BigDeciaml ( stepBD ) it comes out to .0049999999 ...

"I 've faced the following weird case of an incompleteness of the Java/JVM specification . Suppose we have the classes ( we will use Java 1.8 and HotSpot ) : Then recompile the Class to be an interface without recompiling theUser ` : Running the User.main now produces the same output hi . It seems obvious , but I would expect it to fail with the IncompatibleClassChangeError and that 's why : I know that changing a class to an interface is a binary incompatibility according to JVM 5.3.5 # 3 statement : If the class or interface named as the direct superclass of C is , in fact , an interface , loading throws an IncompatibleClassChangeError.But let 's assume we do n't have inheritors of the Class . We now have to refer the JVM specification about method 's resolution.The first version is compiled into this bytecode : So we have here something called CONSTANT_Methodref_info in classpool.Let 's quote the actions of the invokestatic . ... The run-time constant pool item at that index must be a symbolic reference to a method or an interface method ( §5.1 ) , which gives the name and descriptor ( §4.3.3 ) of the method as well as a symbolic reference to the class or interface in which the method is to be found . The named method is resolved ( §5.4.3.3 ) .So the JVM treats method and interface methods in a different manner . In our case , JVM sees the method to be a method of the class ( not interface ) . JVM tries to resolve it accordingly 5.4.3.3 Method Resolution : According to JVM specification , the JVM must fail on the following statement : 1 ) If C is an interface , method resolution throws an IncompatibleClassChangeError ... .because Class is not actually a class , but an interface.Unfortunately , I have n't found any mentions about binary compatibility of changing a class to interface in the Java Language Specification Chapter 13 . Binary Compatibility . Moreover , there is nothing said about such tricky case of referencing the same static method . Could anybody elaborate on that and show me if I missed something ?"

"Context : A new class say Bar , is injected into the JVM at run-time . This class belongs to a package say com.foo.A reference to this class is injected into another class that belongs to the same package.The new class may have a different name each time it is loaded - so this can not be specified as part of any config file - e.g . can not be specified in build.xml to be included as part of a jar file.Issue : At class load time , jvm throws an error - java Result 1 . Although I can not conclusively determine the root cause , it looks like the newly injected class is not being found by class loader.The server was run in verbose mode which shows the list of classes loaded by the JVM and this newly injected class is seen loaded.Question : Is the newly injected class already in the classpath ? If not how to set it ? [ Edit ] - adding some code to the question.Code segment - 1 : This code segment below is called from the PreMain method - Premain method will be called by JVM agent and will inject the instrumentation reference at run time .

"Generally I 've always seen try-with-resources used to allocate a new object instance whose close ( ) method is invoked as it goes out-of-scope.As far as I can tell , creating a new object is not a requirement and the try-with-resources syntax simply needs a local variable to call close ( ) on when that goes out-of-scope . Therefore you can use it to control `` paired operations '' such as allocating something from a pool and making sure it is returned.For example , MyHandle below shows how to release a pooled instance when you no longer need it : Is this considered bad form ? EDIT : I guess I 'm asking if there 's better alternatives to building this sort of logic , or if there 's some major drawback when going with the approach above .

"IntroductionHuh , this is a tough one . At least , I think so ... To clear things up : I did not find any answers to my question after searching the internet ( using Google ) .Everything I found was about people setting up the onClickListener 's for their View 's wrong . I guess it is the same problem in my case , but none of the other problems matched mine . This seems to be the same problem ... It has no answers.SetupI 've got three Fragment 's set up together with a ViewPager in my AppCompatActivity.Handled by the SectionsPagerAdapter.In each of the Fragment 's I have some content plus a custom TabIndicator . ( the following xml file is my View 's for the indicator ) And then I set an OnClickListener for each of those View 's ( dividers ) in the Fragment 's onCreateView ( LayoutInflater inflater , ViewGroup Bundle savedInstanceState ) method . The OnClickListener is already prepared in my Activity where I also instantiate my ViewPager so that I can change the current Item ( Fragment/tab ) .I pass that OnClickListener to the Fragment 's by putting it into my newInstance ( View.OnClickListener tabIndicatorOnClick ) method . This is for one of the fragments . It is identical for the others ! My putIndicatorTabIndicatorOnClick ( View.OnClickListener tabIndicatorOnClick ) method is a Void in an Interface . It just applies the OnClickListener to the Class ( Fragment ) .Does it workYes it does . It works perfectly fine ... until a ConfigurationChange happens . In my case I tested it with changing the orientation.The ProblemWhat happens after that ConfigurationChange is that everything goes normally . The OnClickListener gets applied to all View 's in all Fragment 's , but the tabIndicatorOnClick OnClickListener is a null object reference in the second and third Fragment . So in PostWriter and TopPage there is n't even really an OnClickListener on the View 's for what ever reason . But it gets better : In MainTextHolder Fragment the tabIndicatorOnClick is not a null object reference , but it does not change the ViewPager 's Item anymore . It runs the code , but it does not scroll the Tab.When turning on `` Do n't keep activities '' ind Developer options of the device and leaving the app , all OnClickListener 's are null object references . Even those in MainTextHolder.SummaryAfter the ConfigurationChange the OnClickListener gets passed into my first Fragment , but it is no working properly and in the remaining Fragment 's it is not even passed / a null object reference.The issue can be replicated through destroying the Activity and then reloading it.In the end ... ... I have no clue what is going wrong . I hope that I structured my question properly . May be of interest minSdkVersion : 14 targetSdkVersion : 25I already have a SpringIndicator on my ViewPager . This does not feature an OnClickListener so I added my own `` overlayed '' indicators which have the needed OnClick feature . I also like the look of it , but if you can give me a better solution for my TabIndicator , I would also love to have that as an answer.I came across the solution to put the method into the xml : onClick attribute multiple times , but for that I would need to create the same OnClickListener for every Fragment which is not really the nice way and it is also not solving my problem , but a way around it . - I would need to pass the ViewPager into my Fragment and then call that method from xml which is , as I said , just another way of doing it and not the way I prefer to do it . Also I do n't know if it works . I 'll most likely test it.Other OnClickListener 's in the Fragment still work properly . So as I said the problem lays in the OnClickListener itself not working right/being a null object reference ."

I have an object which has a few arrays as fields . It 's class roughly looks like this : All of the invoice types have a mutual marker interface Invoices . I need to get all of the invoices to invoke another method on them.The problem is that all invoices only have the marker interface in common . The method getCustomerID ( ) is not defined by a mutual interface or class . This is a behaviour I can not change due to a given specification . The code repetition inside the for-each-loop is something that bugs me . I have to do the exact same thing on all invoice objects in the four different arrays . Hence four for-each-loops that unecessary bloat the code . Is there a way that I can write a general ( private ) method ? One idea was : But this would require four instanceof checks because the class Invoice does n't know the method getCusomterId ( ) . Therefore I would gain nothing ; the method would still contain repetitions . I 'm thankful for every possible solution to generalize this problem !

I have only tagged C++ and Java because I 'm proficient with them , and will most likely understand your code-samples if they are written in those ( or similar ) languages.What am I looking for ? Pointers and insight on security measures that I should take into consideration when developing software , mainly games , such as the one described below . By security I mean checking and double checking that a user does n't act in a way not intended . This could mean behaviour such as sending his/her updated collection of the most malicious viruses in existance to the server/other clients , or otherwise compromise the user-experience for other players by , for example , hacking.Expected comments and answers Are you asking how to stop people from hacking your game ? This is not by any means my question , as it 's way too broad for this thread . If you however do come across a simple way to win every game ( by cheating ) , then please , tell me . This question is better suited in XI have asked this very question in CodeReview and in Programmers ; in both networks the post was badly received . It was badly received in here as well , to be fair ( referring to the comment by ADTC ) , hence the bounty . After placing the bounty I have rewritten this post to better meet the standards of SO . If , however , you still think this post does n't suit here well , please tell me why . I 've had a hard time determining if this really is better suited in SO or Programmers , so do n't think this is just a dump that I posted here after not thinking about it for a second . To create a connection between two machines , you should use Sockets . Google it.I am not looking for this kind of technical help . I know how to implement the software , and it 's not the first time I 'm doing this . Please look at the actual question I asked.Why am I asking this ? The software in questionI 'm developing a snake-like multiplayer game where players can use their own algorithms to determine the next move of their snake . The players are connected to each other with a client-server connection , that is , one player will act as the host . You can assume that the server code will wait until all players have made their turns until updating the game-state between all the clients.About the gameMy game searches a folder for any compatible .jar files , whose main class extend a particular abstract class . The player can then connect to another player ( s ) over the network by directly connecting to them or by searching a game from a lobby.While playing , each player will use their own algorithm to determine the next move of their snake . The duration of each game may vary a lot , depending on the update rate that has been specified for the game , but most of the time they are fast and will most likely end in less than 30 seconds.I 'm not as far yet as implementing the actual network multiplayer.The template source file for a logic is as follows : So what I 'm planning to do is , from the hosting player 's perspective , to get the next move of a player over the network in a String format ( `` up '' , `` down '' , `` left '' , `` right '' ) , so there wo n't be any security issues on that front . The actual program that each each client uses to determine their next move will only ever run on the respective client 's computer.I hope you are following me so far . Anyway , what I am concerned about right now is any other potholes I may have overlooked . Determining all of those potholes may be a bit too tedious of a task to do , so I wont ask that primarily . Giving me insight on the matter is what I 'm expecting . Ideally I can get a bigger picture from multiple answers by different people.The question that floats on top of the others is that can I prevent any of the clients from using methods on their programs that would compromise the user experience for the other player ( s ) ? Such methods could be for example Thread.sleep ( ) : it would be pretty annoying if a player made his algorithm wait for 10 minutes between each move . For this particular problem I figured I 'd set a time limit for each move , after which the lagging/malicious player will be kicked or assigned a default move so the game can continue normally.Off-note : @ Darinth 's answer reminded me of a very important aspect of the game : user input is allowed , meaning that the next move of the snake can be determined by a human player - that is , the game can be played normally with a keyboard . Additionally , nothing restricts you to choose between a pure AI and a keyboard-only-solution : you can mix them together and , for example , control the snake yourself and let the AI take over when it notices you are driving yourself into a trap.To wrap it upHave I overlooked something big ? I have planned for this to be a small project for me and my friends to kill time with , but I 'm a bit of an enthusiast.Please answer without hesitation , no matter how small your idea is . You can later edit the answer to be more comprehensive , should you think of more points of interest . I will check any answers for edits regularly.Thank you for your time.Relevant ideas I have received from answers or on my ownCompare hash of game-state with all the clients after every move . All but the players with the same hash will be kicked , with the minimum requirement that the host will be kept in the game ( if there are 4 players , out of which 2 players have one hash , and the other 2 players have another hash , the group that does n't include the host will be kicked , etc. ) . I came up with this one , however it 's thanks to @ ToYono , so the credit goes to him.Before the game starts , compare the checksum of each player . All players with differing checksum from the host will be kicked ( or not even let in the game ) . Credit goes to @ ToYono.Randomize any ranked matches . Prevents the effective use of using multiple connections from the same machine to play in the same game . If one player play multiple snakes in one game , he could have one algorithm that tries to play the game legitly , and two algorithms that simply sabotage the other player . Credit goes to @ Surt.User input is allowed . This was designed to be a part of the game from the start , but I forgot to mention it . Credit to @ Darinth for coming up with the possibility and thus reminding me of this important aspect ."

"In an effort to design components that are as reusable as possible , I got to thinking recently about the possibility of so-called `` adapter annotations .

I would need to annotate all of my test methods as follows : But what if , after creating a test suite with , say , 1000 test classes , I decide I want to begin unit testing with some brand new super-cool testing framework that requires all test methods to be annotated as follows : Now , in this particular example it might be perfectly feasible to search-n-replace the old annotations for the new ones , but in a practicle application , this would not be a feasible solution.So would it be possible for me `` wrap '' my unit test annotations with something homegrown , like : And then build my own annotation processor that would convert instances of @ HomegrownUnitTestAnnotation to whichever annotation I currently need ( either @ Test or @ SuperCoolUnitTest ( someParam= '' true '' ) ) ? Obviously , this question applies to all annotations , not just those provided by JUnit . I 'm basically asking if it is possible to wrap 3rd party annotations for the sake of reusability/separation of concerns/etc . Thanks in advance !"

"I am getting the following ( confusing ) warning when using annotation-based null analysis where an array is involved : Null type safety ( type annotations ) : The expression of type 'int [ ] ' needs unchecked conversion to conform to 'int @ Nullable [ ] 'This occurs when I pass an unannotated int [ ] to an int @ Nullable [ ] parameter.This is surprising . Normally it is only a problem if you take a nullable value and try to pass it to a nonnull parameter , but I am doing the opposite - taking a known non-null ( though not annotated ) array and passing it to a method ( Arrays.equals ) which does accept nulls.Also it does not seem to be a problem with non-array objects . Normally a variable or return of ( unannotated , non-array ) type T can be assigned to a @ Nullable T.So my question is why does this change when T is an array type ? My class is a hashable/equality-comparable proxy for a native class that uses an int [ ] ( taken from a C++ function ) as a unique identifier . My package uses annotation-based null analysis and the 3rd-party package ( with the native class ) does not.Here 's a cut-down version that shows the problem : TagKey.java : package-info.java : Tag.java : ( partial ) The workaround I am currently using : I would prefer to avoid these approaches : Adding @ SuppressWarnings ( `` null '' ) to TagKey or its equals method ( The production version is somewhat more complex and has a high risk of embarrassing NPEs . ) Notes : My JDT version is 3.10.0.v20140606-1215Earlier I made the mistake of declaring @ Nullable int [ ] id .

"Link to the problem can be found here Problem Statement Burger Town is a city that consists of N special junctions and N−1 pathways . There is exactly one shortest path between each pair of junctions . Junction i is located at ( xi , yi ) and the distance between two junctions i , j is defined by the Taxicab geometry . Tim has recently afforded a taxicab to work as a taxicab driver . His vehicle was very cheap , but has a very big flaw . It can only drive H units horizontally and V units vertically before refueling . If a customer wants to be brought from a junction i to another junction j , then this car is only capable of driving the route , iff the sum of horizontal distances and the sum of vertical distances on this path are less than or equal to H and V respectively . Also , there is a unique path between any two junctions . Now he has thoughts about returning the vehicle back to the seller . But he first wants to know , if it 's even worth it . That 's why he wants to know the number of unordered pairs ( i , j ) such that it is not possible to drive a customer from junction i to junction j .

"It appears the Java Memory Model does not define `` refreshing '' and `` flushing '' of the local cache , instead people only call it that way for simplicity , but actually the `` happens-before '' relationship implies refreshing and flushing somehow ( would be great if you can explain that , but not directly part of the question ) .This is getting me really confused combined with the fact that the section about the Java Memory Model in the JLS is not written in a way which makes it easy to understand.Therefore could you please tell me if the assumptions I made in the following code are correct and if it is therefore guaranteed to run correctly ?

"I throw a bunch of custom runtime exceptions in my code and I want to make sure that in all public methods , I document which runtime exception might be thrown ( by myself ) and why . This would be very hulpful since I 'm maintaining a library which is used by many projects and I want it to be upfront and predictable regarding thrown ( runtime ) exceptions.Is there a compiler option , maven plugin , Intellij plugin or custom tool that can help me find missed throws clauses ? With checked exceptions it 's easy , the compiler will just complain if I missed one , but for runtime exceptions both throws and @ throws are not enforced.One thing I thought of was to temporarily make all my own runtime exceptions checked exceptions ( they already share a super class ) , but that would be a one-off exercise . I would like to verify my code/documentation each time I make changes so I can never forget to document my runtime exceptions.Another way could be to actually have checked exceptions throughout the code and convert them to runtime only in the public api : This approach would force me to think about CheckedFooException in all public methods . Then to check if I missed documenting one ( ie . @ throws RuntimeFooException ) , I would simply do a regex search on catch . *CheckedFooException and check for missing @ throws entries . Rather unwieldy process though ( and there 's a lot of public api that would get peppered with try ... catch statements ) .Answer : There is some discussion about whether you should document ( your own thrown ) runtime exceptions at all ( the summary so far : it depends ) , but as far as a direct answer to my question , the accepted answer answers it adequately ; I can take that approach , implement my use case and even make a maven plugin with it , given some time and effort .

"My question is in regard to the way Java handles String literals . It 's quite clear from the Java Language Specs ( JLS ) that String literals are being implicitly interned - in other words , objects that are created in the String constant pool part of the heap , in contrast to the heap-based objects created when calling new String ( `` whatever '' ) .What does n't seem to line up with what the JLS says is that when creating a new String using String concatenation with a casted constant String type , which should be considered as a constant String as per the JLS , apparently the JVM is creating a new String object rather than interning it implicitly . I appreciate any explanation about this particular behaviour and whether or not this is a platform-specific behaviour . I am running on a Mac OSX Snow Leopard ."

"I came accross the following code : This code just uses an intermediate TreeSet to remove duplicates , where equality among elements is defined as per the provided comparator.Let 's give local type inference an opportunity , I ( naively ) thought ... So I changed the above code to : This made sense to me , because the type of set can be inferred from the type of comparator , or so I thought . However , the modified code does n't compile and generates the following error : Now , I understand why the error occurs and I admit that the type of the comparator is actually Comparator < ? super T > , so the type inferred by var is TreeSet < ? super T > . However , I wonder why var is n't able to infer the generic type of TreeSet as just T instead of ? super T. After all , according to the docs , a TreeSet < E > has a constructor that accepts an argument of type Comparator < ? super E > . So invoking this constructor should create a TreeSet < E > , not a TreeSet < ? super E > . ( This is what the first snippet shows ) . I expected var to follow this same logic.Note 1 : One way to make the code compile would be to change the return type to Set < ? super T > . However , that would be a hardly usable set ... Note 2 : Another way would be to not use contravariance in the comparator , but I do n't want this , because I would n't be able to use a Comparator that compares ancestors of T.Note 3 : I know that the first snippet works , so it seems obvious that I should stick to not using var and declare the set explicitly as Set < T > . However , my question is not whether I should discard my second snippet or how to fix it . Instead , I 'd like to know why var is not inferring TreeSet < T > as the type of the set local variable in my 2nd snippet.EDIT 1 : In this comment , user @ nullpointer correctly points out that I should make the following subtle change to make the 2nd snippet compile : Now the generic type parameter T is explicit for TreeSet , so var correctly infers the type of the set local variable as TreeSet < T > . Still , I 'd like to know why I must specify T explicitly.EDIT 2 : In this other comment , user @ Holger cleverly mentions that the following is forbidden in the language : The code above fails to compile with the following error : So now the question becomes more evident : if I can not explicitly specify the bounded generic type ? super T in the instantiation expression new TreeSet < ? super T > ( comparator ) , why is the compiler infering TreeSet < ? super T > as the type of the set local variable ?"

"My Hazelcast-based program can work in two modes : submitter and worker .

"I 'm trying to implement something in a semi-efficient manner .

"How would I go about reasonably efficiently finding the shortest possible output given by repeatedly applying replacements to an input sequence ? I believe ( please correct me if I am wrong ) that this is exponential-time in the worst case , but I am not sure due to the second constraint below . The naive method certainly is.I tried coding the naive method ( for all possible replacements , for all valid positions , recurse on a copy of the input after applying the replacement at the position . Return the shortest of all valid recursions and the input , with a cache on the function to catch equivalent replacement sequences ) , but it is ( unworkably ) slow , and I 'm pretty sure it 's an algorithmic issue as opposed to the implementation.A couple of things that may ( or may not ) make a difference : Token is an enumerated type.The length of the output of each entry in the map is strictly less than the input of the entry.I do not need what replacements were done and where , just the resulting sequence.So , as an example where each character is a token ( for simplicity 's sake ) , if I have the replacement map as aaba - > a , aaa - > ab , and aba - > bb , and I apply minimalString ( 'aaaaa ' ) , I want to get ' a'.The actual method signature is something along the following lines : Is there a better method than brute-force ? If not , is there , for example , a SAT library or similar that could be harnessed ? Is there any preprocessing to the map that could be done to make it faster when called multiple times with different token lists but with the same replacement map ?"

"In my Android App I use a BehaviourSubject `` to get data '' from a data provider to my UI and other services that need the data . For the sake of an example , let 's assume these are messages for our user.Whenever a refresh of the data ( e.g . messages ) is triggered , the data provider will do a `` long running '' ( aka `` slow '' ) network call to retrieve message and feed them into the subject by invoking the subject 's onNext ( data ) operation , thus `` broadcasting '' the update to the UI and the other subscribers.This works well , but I 'm having a problem with the initialisation of the subject or put another way with setting the initial value of the subject on app start.I know that I can set an initial value via BehaviorSubject.create ( initialValue ) , but as the initialValue is the result of the network call , this would block the initialisation of the subject.I currently do the following in my data provider 's init : where getDataFromNetwork ( ) returns an Observable for the result of the network call.Question : The above construct of wiring the observable that refreshes from network by hand into the BehaviourSubject somehow feels wrong/not elegant .

I guess no any object is created.But does this mean that the Java Intepreter needs to search all the interned strings ? will this cause any performance issue ? 3.Seems String s3 = new String ( `` abc '' ) does not use interned string.Why ? 4.Will String s5 = new String ( `` def '' ) create any new interned string ?
"I 'm a bit exasperated with this issue . Lets check if someone has implemented something similar . I have a java 8 web application with 8 WS implemented . Some of this WS , make inserts and updates through JDBCTemplate ( Hibernate is not a choice due to performance needs ) and i need them to rollback if execution crashes with an exception . I have the following configuration of datasource and transaction manager in spring app context file ( jndi resource in server.xml/context.xml of Tomcat ) : On the other hand I have a unique accesspoint to the dataBase DBcontroller.class , which has a generic method for inserts , deletes and updates : Finally I have a WS Interface This way : with its implementation : with a `` transactional '' method : It should be working ok on a non WS project , but as I have discovered there is no so easy way for making this work.First I thought it did n't rollback , but now I 'm quite sure it does n't create transactions . There are some similar post in stackoverflow , but none of them fix my problem . I have google it a lot , and the only way suggested is WS-AtomicTransactions , which I have never heard about.I have try almost everything in XML configuration file , I have even tried to manage transactions programatically , but as it is a pool of connections I 'm not able to set autocommit to false so that I can force rollbacks .

"From Chapter 4 of Effective Java the following example is given : [ ... ] It is the most flexible because it allows the use of multiple package-private implementation classes . To its clients that reside outside its package , the immutable class is effectively final because it is impossible to extend a class that comes from another package and that lacks a public or protected constructor.I understand that the class is effectively final , but is there any actual advantage from not declaring it final ? Omitting this keyword when the class does n't support extension seems like a less clear way to communicate how the API is meant to be used . Or was final only left out here to show the reader that non-extendable , non-final classes are possible ?"

"UPDATE : To help clarify what I 'm asking I have posted a little java code that gets the idea across.A while ago I asked a question on how to get an algorithm to break down a set of numbers , the idea was to give it a list of numbers ( 1,2,3,4,5 ) and a total ( 10 ) and it would figure out all the multiples of each number that would add up to the total ( ' 1*10 ' or ' 1*1,1*2,1*3,1*4 ' or ' 2*5 ' , etc.. ) . It was the first programming exercise I ever did so it took me a while and I got it working but now I want to try to see if I can scale it . The person in the original question said it was scalable but I 'm a bit confused at how to do it . The recursive part is the area I 'm stuck at scaling the part that combines all the results ( the table it is referring to is not scalable but applying caching I am able to make it fast ) I have the following algorithm ( pseudo code ) : I 'm really at a loss at how to thread/multiprocess the RecursivelyListAllThatWork function . I know if I send it a smaller K ( which is int of total number of items in list ) it will process that subset but I do n't know how to do ones that combine results across the subset . For example , if list is [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 ] and I send it K=3 then only the 1,2,3 get processed which is fine but what about if I need results that include 1 and 10 ? I have tried to modify the table ( variable T ) so only the subset I want are there but still does n't work because , like the solution above , it does a subset but can not process answers that require a wider range.I do n't need any code just if someone can explain how to conceptually break this recursive step to so other cores/machines can be used . UPDATE : I still ca n't seem to figure out how to turn RecursivelyListAllThatWork into a runnable ( I know technically how to do it , but I do n't understand how to change the RecursivelyListAllThatWork algorithm so it can be ran in parallel . The other parts are just here to make the example work , I only need to implement runnable on RecursivelyListAllThatWork method ) . Here 's the java code :"

"Why do the MouseEvents in Java share modifiers between keys and mouse buttons ?

This is well documented , and there is even a line in the Javadocs for MouseEvent mentioning this overlap . But my question is , why is it reported like this ?

In Java for example there is the primitive data type `` int '' which represents a 32 Bit value and there is `` Integer '' which is just a class with a single `` int '' property ( and some methods of course ) . That means that a Java `` Integer '' class still uses primitives behind the scenes . And that 's the reason Java is not a pure object oriented programming language.Where could a value be stored if there where no primitives ? For example I imagine this pseudo class : This would be recursive.How can a programming language be implemented without primitives ? I appreciate any help solving my confusion .

"For a long time I measured passed time using System.currentTimeMillis ( ) and only recently figured out that I can also use nanoTime ( ) . However some results were not what I expected , as nanoTime measures the time from an arbitrary point in time instead of 01-01-1970 as currentTimeMillis does.From the JavaDoc for nanoTime : Returns the current value of the most precise available system timer , in nanoseconds . This method can only be used to measure elapsed time and is not related to any other notion of system or wall-clock time . The value returned represents nanoseconds since some fixed but arbitrary time ( perhaps in the future , so values may be negative ) . This method provides nanosecond precision , but not necessarily nanosecond accuracy . No guarantees are made about how frequently values change . Differences in successive calls that span greater than approximately 292 years ( 263 nanoseconds ) will not accurately compute elapsed time due to numerical overflow . For example , to measure how long some code takes to execute : I am confused by the arbitrary part . Measuring the passed time is only accurate if the reference timestamp is the same for both calls . However in the API documentation this is not guaranteed . I think that this was the cause for my mentioned issues . The time that is used is an implementation detail and therefore I can not rely on it.I am wondering about , when I can make good use of nanoTime and in which cases it goes horribly wrong . The main use cases that come to mind are : Comparing nanoTime timestamps from different threadsComparing nanoTime timestamps from different instances of the same JVM ( think , serialized timestamp from a previous application run , or passed as part of a message to a different JVM ) Comparing nanoTime timestamps in different JVM implementationsThere are some posts here on StackOverflow that address part of the issue , but largely leave the issue of the choosing of the time open : System.currentTimeMillis vs System.nanoTimeIs System.nanoTime ( ) completely useless ? Especially the link in the last one makes it clear that there are limitations when nanoTime can be used , but without knowing these limitations exactly it seems inherently unsafe to use it at all as the functionality that is built upon it may fail ."

"How can I check if a stream instance has been consumed or not ( meaning having called a terminal operation such that any further call to a terminal operation may fail with IllegalStateException : stream has already been operated upon or closed . ?

"I am considering submitting an RFE ( request for enhancement ) to Oracle Bug Database which is supposed to significantly increase string concatenation performance . But before I do it I 'd like to hear experts ' comments on whether it makes sense . The idea is based on the fact that the existing String.concat ( String ) works two times faster on 2 strings than StringBuilder . The problem is that there is no method to concatenate 3 or more strings . External methods can not do this because String.concat uses a package private constructor String ( int offset , int count , char [ ] value ) which does not copy the char array but uses it directly . This ensure high String.concat performance . Being in the same package StringBuilder still can not use this constructor because then the String 's char array will be exposed for modifications . I suggest to add the following methods to StringNote : this kind of overloading is used in EnumSet.of , for efficiency.This is the implementation of one of the methods , others work the same wayAlso , after these methods are added to String , Java compiler for will be able to build efficientinstead of current inefficientUPDATE Performance test . I ran it on my notebook Intel Celeron 925 , concatenation of 3 strings , my String2 class emulates exactly how it would be in real java.lang.String .

"I 'm currently working on a bigger Java desktop-application and now are at the point where I want to add translations . What bothers me about the l18n-system is , that it does n't provide any kind of compiletime checking.In java 's system , you have something like a HashMap , where every localized string has a `` Key '' and the translated string then is the `` Value '' . This looks something like this ( taken from the tutorials example ) : This works nice if you have a simple/small application . But in a big application with thousands of translated strings , it might so happen that you have a typo in the `` Key '' and therefore get an empty or wrong string.With a little luck , the application throws a RuntimeException to tell you about it , but even then it is possible that you do n't even come to this point because the wrong `` Key '' is used in a dialog that might not show up under certain circumstances ( say it 's an error dialog ) .To prevent this from happening , using a system which offers compiletime checking of the used `` Keys '' would be the better idea . This is for example used in Android , where you specify the Resources in an XML-file which is then indexed and mapped to a class ( including the `` Keys '' to use ) . This way , you get something like this ( from the Android Docs ) : If you have a typo in that `` key '' , you 'll get an error at compile-time ( also you have `` auto-completion '' from your IDE ) .Now , to make something like this work , you 'll need a little tool/script that does the indexing part and generates the Resource-class ( R.java ) . In Android , the Eclipse-plugin ( or your IDE in general ) does that for you.My question now is : Is there already a system that that I can use for normal desktop-applications in Java ? Or am I horribly wrong with what I 'm saying ?"

Repeat this process for few times.How can I achieve this . Many thanks in advance.I have done the following ."

Another example iswhich is again pretty obviously mixing types in an unrealistic way.So , are there more subtle cases in which heap pollution happens under parameterized varargs ?

"I 've been reading Java Puzzlers by Bloch and Gafter and got to the puzzle 10 ( Tweedledee ) . The essence of this puzzle is to provide declarations for the variables x and i such that this is a legal statement : but this is not : The solution to this looks , according to the book , like this : The book claims that in the += operator the right-hand expression can be of any type only if the left-hand expression has type String . However , I tried to run this code , and it compiled and ran without any problems.Then I dug into the Java Language Specification . Section 15.26.2 talks about two cases : when the left-hand expression is an array access expression and when it 's not . If the left-hand operand expression is not an array access expression , then JLS does n't say anything about the left-hand expression being a String . When it is , this part appllies : If T is a reference type , then it must be String . Because class String is a final class , S must also be String . Therefore the run-time check that is sometimes required for the simple assignment operator is never required for a compound assignment operator . ❖ The saved value of the array component and the value of the right-hand operand are used to perform the binary operation ( string concatenation ) indicated by the compound assignment operator ( which is necessarily += ) . If this operation completes abruptly , then the assignment expression completes abruptly for the same reason and no assignment occurs.T here is the type of the left-hand operand as determined at compile-time , and S is the selected array component . So I thought that I would modify my code into this : But even this code compiles and runs without any problems even though new Object ( ) is not even remotely a String.Why is this happening ? Does this mean that Java compiler deviates from the JLS ? And is it still possible to somehow solve the original puzzle ?"
"I am in the process of optimizing an algorithm , and I noticed that Hibernate creates and releases update statements repetitively instead of reusing them . These are all from the same query.The algorithm 's main method has a @ Scope and a @ Transactional annotation .

The service is the one using Hibernate to update the database , with session.update ( entity ) . The documentation says that , by default , nested transactions reuse the transaction if it exists . Is that affirmation above correct ? Can the scope change create problems ? How can I have Hibernate reuse the statement during the transaction ? Thanks for your attention"

"I have found a problem where a shared library that is called with JNA under jetty gets stuck when printing to stderr.I have simplified the problem to make it easy to reproduce by first creating a very simple C shared library which does nothing more than call fprintf ( stderr , '' 0123456789\n '' ) ; 100 times , then return.On the java side we have a synchronise statement on a global lock to ensure only one thread is in the shared library at a time.I deploy this under jetty and make constant requests to jetty to call the shared library eventually ( after less than 100 requests ) I find that the shared library gets stuck.Using jstack we can see the thread which is stuck inside the call to the shared library ( classes have been renamed ) : Using gdb I am able to get a backtrace from within my shared library : line 357 is a fprintf ( ) line.I was concerned that perhaps the issue was something getting stuck only readying from stdout and never stderr . Within java I created a thread which keeps printing to stdout and stderr and I can see both.I also tried to see what would happen if we did 100 calls to System.err.println ( `` 9876543210 '' ) ; within java and , however that did not cause a thread in java to get stuck.Originally when logging this stderr and stdout was redirected with : I was able to see what the shared lib was writing to stderr in the log file . I then removed the redirection of stderr and stdout that and noticed I could no longer see what the shared library was writing to stderr , however I could see that System.err.println ( ) was printing.When I tried calling the shared library within a test ( without jetty ) I was unable to reproduce the problem . I ran my test from both eclipse and maven . I also tried redirecting stderr and stdout as above however I found that only writes to stderr and stdout within java was redirected ( i.e . fprintf ( ) to stderr from within the shared library continued to show up in eclipse or in the console ) .

I use AnnotationAwareOrderComparator.sort ( beans ) for that .

Is there a BeanPostProcessor or an config option that I have to enable ? How do I tell spring to either preserve the annotated order or use the application context 's bean definitions to sort the beans appropriately ?

"The constructors for TreeSet include , besides the standard ones , one which allows you to supply a Comparator and one which allows you to create one from another SortedSet : The second of these is rather too close in its declaration to the standard `` conversion constructor ” : As Joshua Bloch explains in Effective Java ( item “ Use overloading judiciously ” in the chapter on Methods ) , calling one of two constructor or method overloads which take parameters of related type can give confusing results . This is because , in Java , calls to overloaded constructors and methods are resolved at compile time on the basis of the static type of the argument , so applying a cast to an argument can make a big difference to the result of the call , as the following code shows : This problem afflicts the constructors for all the sorted collections in the Framework ( TreeSet , TreeMap , ConcurrentSkipListSet , and ConcurrentSkipListMap ) . To avoid it in your own class designs , choose parameter types for different overloads so that an argument of a type appropriate to one overload can not be cast to the type appropriate to a different one . If that is not possible , the two overloads should be designed to behave identically with the same argument , regardless of its static type . For example , a PriorityQueue constructed from a collection uses the ordering of the original , whether the static type with which the constructor is supplied is one of the Comparator-containing types PriorityQueue or SortedSet , or just a plain Collection . To achieve this , the conversion constructor uses the Comparator of the supplied collection , only falling back on natural ordering if it does not have one.Currently , I am reading the book called Java Generics and Collections , and above is something I do n't understand [ page185~186 ] .First , I do n't quite understand why it uses this example and what things it want to illustrate.Second , I do n't quite understand the concept of `` conversion constructor '' . Is it because of the existence of conversion constructor , that we should use overloading judiciously ?"

"Looking at the akka cluster documentation it appears that you have to know the server & port values of at least 1 `` seed node '' to join the cluster . The example application.conf clearly indicates that the developer needs to know `` host1 '' and `` host2 '' when writing the file : But , consider the possibility of registering each cluster node with a DNS load balancer .

In other words , Is it possible to use dynamic , load balancing , names to join an akka cluster ? A priori there is one potential issue : a node may get itself as the seed node on the first try .

Each Entity has a method getTransformationMatrix ( ) which returns a Matrix4f , that is then passed into the entity shader . ProblemThe model needs to point in the direction of the camera , as well as rotate around the camera , such that it is always in front .

This is my current implementation : YawPitchI have done some research but I fear I have been stuck on this too long and need some fresh eyes . When I try to combine these 2 calculations , the model seems to move in the shape of a graph when looking at any yaw angle other than 0 . Below is my attempt of combining these : The Transform.createTransformationMatrix ( ) looks like the following : ThoughtsA friend suggested creating a unit vector that points in the direction of up , ( ie . new Vector3f ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) ) rotating the Vector by the pitch and yaw , then multiplying the Vector by the radius and adding it to the camera 's position . I tried this , but I do n't know how to rotate a Vector by an angle , and there seems to be no Vector3f.rotate ( ) method in the slick-utils Vector3f class . Any help is is thoroughly appreciated as this has been giving me a headache for the past few days . Thanks !"
"We have our project hosted in OpenShift ( OKD to be precise . We host it ourselves ) . The setup is as follows : Routing server ( Spring Boot 1.5.8 with Zuul ) : This one takes all the incoming traffic and routes it to the correct servicesMultiple services ( all with Spring Boot ) : Here is all the business logicWe use SOAP for calling other services in this project.Currently , when we call the application , the call goes to the routing server , which then routes it to the main business service.After a short inactivity of about one hour , our main business service is not reachable via the external call . The edge server however is available and callable 100 % of the time . We do get a 504 Gateway Timeout exception from the system when we call it . We already figured out that this is the timeout of the route in openshift ( haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout in the route ) .The core problem is , that OpenShift seems to hibernate the main business service after an inactivity of about one hour . After a delay of 15 minutes however the calls seem to find their destination and the data gets processed correctly.How can we turn this behaviour off ? Edit 1 : We have the same application in normal `` old fashioned '' VMs in production . We do n't have any problems there.We noticed that the services can be `` kept alive '' when we call them regulary . We built a small service which calls theme regulary ( every 15 min ) . This way it seems to work . But this is not a production ready workaround IMO.Edit 2 : Our pod config ( some names are anonymized ) : https : //gist.github.com/moritzluedtke/6867499b0acbb2d7b5a9a70e49b0d45cWe do not use autoscaler.Edit 3 : Our deployment configs ( some names are anonymized ) : https : //gist.github.com/moritzluedtke/dc7c1078fe9cc7e4aeb737094849fc1bEdit 4 : It seems that this is not a problem with OpenShift but rather our tech stack .

"I 'm trying to set the icon of a Java AWT application so it renders in native resolution on the Windows 10 taskbar ( including when desktop scaling is set above 100 % ) . It seems that by default , if an executable embeds an icon containing multiple sizes , Windows seems to pick a size larger than the actual size of taskbar icons and downsize it ( at 100 % scale it resizes the 32 pixel icon to 24 , even if a 24 pixel icon is supplied , and similarly for other scales . ) I 've solved this problem for C++ MFC applications by loading just the correctly sized icon as a resource and sending a WM_SETICON message to the window , which results in a nice sharp icon on the taskbar and alt-tab dialog.That approach does n't seem to work for Java applications - a WM_SETICON message with wParam set to ICON_SMALL works fine , but the equivalent with ICON_BIG is ignored.If I try to use Java 's API to set the icon , by doing thisthe correct icon is used but it appears blurry , as if something has resized it to the `` expected '' size and then resized it back . Left here is how it appears , right is the contents of the icon file.So , my question is : what can I do in this Java application to make Windows render the icon I give it on the taskbar without scaling it and blurring the details ?"

"Am I correct in my thoughts : writing cast ( T ) means `` compiler can not and is not going to check this cast anyway '' . At compile-time the compiler does not know what arg2 would be ( and it could be anything ) , so compiler can not rule out that the cast could work and has to trust the programmer . Thus this cast is just never checked at compile time . In runtime local var declaration looks like Object loc = arg1 ; ( after type erasure ) . So everything works fine just because compiler never cares about this ( T ) cast ? P.S : My research : this , and this . This is also very interesting ( `` casting primitive to generic '' : ( T ) true ) My question is more clearly pinpointed on the problem , the question is also about whether the cast ( T ) checked by the compiler and there are no distractions in the code sample in question ."

"I just inherited a Java application and upon inspection of the code , I 'm seeing what IMHO is a bastardization of the Spring framework .

This is essentially an annotation-based factory with the overhead of Spring.Am I out-of-line , or is this like using an elephant gun to kill flies ?

The team also frowns upon testing though.There 's no mystery here , I hope .

"Everyone who tries to utilize JMH framework to create some meaningful tests will come across JMH sample tests ( http : //hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/tip/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/ ) .As we went through them we stucked by the dead code elemination ( JMHSample_08_DeadCode.java ) .Excerpt : The measurement of measureWrong ( ) will be approximately the same as for the baseline test . Because the return value of the Math.log ( ) is never used . Therefore the HotSpot compiler will eliminate the dead code . Ok , understood but how can the compiler decide that Math.log ( ) can be eliminated.As we looked closely to the test we note that Math.log ( ) is a native method . And native calls go down to the OS and execute a corresponding lib . Right ? This lead us to the assumption that native calls could be eliminated by the compiler if their return value is not used and they do n't perform io operations.We wonder what if the lib which resides somewhere in the OS and which handles the native calls from the java worldprovides no return value but does io operations ( e.g . logging ) .Will those instructions completely be wiped out ? To proof our assumption we reconstructed the scenario with a simple JMH test and a native call.We compiled three c-native libs to perform : returning 42parameter additionempty file creationAs we called them in a JMH test ( similarly to measureWrong ( ) test ) none of them has been eliminated , not even the one which does n't perform an io operation.Due to the test result our assumption can not be confirmed . Native calls can not be optimized out , meaning that Math.log ( ) and custom native calls do not have the same basis . They are not equaly native . Maybe we made a mistake in our native lib code and at least the native call of test 1 should have been eleminated . If this is true we will share our code with you.So we searched further and found a term Intrinsics where java code will be replaced with acorresponding to the architecture very optimized code . java.lang.Math.log ( ) is having such intrinsic implementation . Are there any relations between the Natives and Intrinsics ? If the above assumption of the relationship between Natives and Intrinsics is valid will the compiler perform the following steps to eliminate the native call ? At the compile time the HotSpot checks the existence of the intrinsic implementation ( in jdk ? ) for the Math.log ( ) and replaces Math.log ( ) with that code.Afterwards the second check happens where HotSpot looks after the return value of a method . And on this outcome the HotSpot decides to eliminate the Math.log ( ) call completely ."

"I wrote two matrix classes in Java just to compare the performance of their matrix multiplications . One class ( Mat1 ) stores a double [ ] [ ] A member where row i of the matrix is A [ i ] . The other class ( Mat2 ) stores A and T where T is the transpose of A.Let 's say we have a square matrix M and we want the product of M.mult ( M ) .

On 1000x1000 matrices the second algorithm takes about 1.2 seconds on my machine , while the first one takes at least 25 seconds . I was expecting the second one to be faster , but not by this much . The question is , why is it this much faster ? My only guess is that the second one makes better use of the CPU caches , since data is pulled into the caches in chunks larger than 1 word , and the second algorithm benefits from this by traversing only rows , while the first ignores the data pulled into the caches by going immediately to the row below ( which is ~1000 words in memory , because arrays are stored in row major order ) , none of the data for which is cached.I asked someone and he thought it was because of friendlier memory access patterns ( i.e . that the second version would result in fewer TLB soft faults ) .

"I 'm new to Java , learning Java from the Oracle Java tutorial.I 'm now learning about nested classes , static classes and inner classes.I found the following explanation which seems odd , and I think it is wrong.From : https : //docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/nested.html A nested class is a member of its enclosing class . Non-static nested classes ( inner classes ) have access to other members of the enclosing class , even if they are declared private . Static nested classes do not have access to other members of the enclosing classThe last sentence `` Static nested classes do not have access to other members of the enclosing class '' is strange , but may refer to instance members , saying the static class is like a static method , having no access to instance variables.But the next note is even stranger : Note : A static nested class interacts with the instance members of its outer class ( and other classes ) just like any other top-level class . In effect , a static nested class is behaviorally a top-level class that has been nested in another top-level class for packaging convenience.This seems odd , as it implies that a static class can not access private instance members of the outer class .

"Sorry if this was already explained , but i did n't find similar threads anywhere in web.Today I opened one project class in IDE and saw an error ( red underline ) , though project was compiled successfully.So , the code is : And now we call this method like this : Idea13 gives me error ( incompatible types ) - I think that 's right.Idea14 does not show any errors here.JDK compiles it without errors - that 's sad.Must say , that in our project implementation class of A interface always implements B interface ( possibly explains why Idea14 says it is OK ) , but in my opinion that ca n't justify this behaviour - because generally I can create class that implements A and does n't implement B.

"I am not good at programmatically implementing a heuristic search algorithm / Dijkstra 's algorithm/ A* search algorithm mentioned . However , while solving a problem mentioned in one of my post ( Matrix manipulation : logic not fetching correct answer for higher order NXN matrix data ) , I found a flaw in my approach to solve the problem . The problem statement is as below.Problem StatementThere is a NxN matrix , divided into N * N cells . Each cell has a predefined value . Which would be given as an input . Iteration has to happen K number of times which is also given in the test input . We have to make sure that we pick the optimum/min value of rows/columns at each iteration . Final output is the cumulative sum of optimum value saved at the end of each iteration.Steps 1 . Sum up the individual row and column and find the min sum of rows and columns , ( it could be a row or a column , just need the minimum row or a column ) Step 2 . Store the sum found above separatelyStep 3 . Increment elements of the min . sum row or column . by 1Repeat steps 1,2,3 from 1 to Kth valueadd the sum at each iteration ( specified in step2 ) output is the sum obtained on on the Kth iteration.Sample dataOutput data22My CodeIssue with my CodeThis solution was working for some lower order matrix and simple scenarios , however , when I tried test cases that involved 100x100 sized matrix many test cases failed . Initially , I thought it was some memory issue/stack overflow when the array size increases but now I have worked out that it is a flaw in the code that I am not able to anticipate the correct path that would eventually guides me to the optimum solution I 'd like to achieve . The flaw that I found in my code is , say , in one scenario when the optimum value from both rows and columns is equal . I am free to choose row or column , however , the problem here is , say , if I go with row first it may update the values of row to some non-optimum value , I believe only I 'd know all the optimum paths beforehand would help me get the correct answer.Any help in this regard would be highly appreciated.This question has a reference to question asked here . Matrix manipulation : logic not fetching correct answer for higher order NXN matrix dataOnly when Higher order matrix is used I get the below difference in output when I apply the above approach.Edit : Case 3 ( my output was 50778 and the expected was 50708 ) Case 2 sample data below ( my output was 30066 and the expected was 30050 )"

"This question might be similar to Java overload confusionI 'm reading a book and there 's a topic regarding method overloading from which a compiler may not be able to resolve the method being called . The example on the book uses overloaded method with two parameters ( int , double ) and ( double , int ) .

"I 'm doing an inter-procedrual analysis project in Java at the moment and I 'm looking into using an IFDS solver to compute the control flow graph of a program . I 'm finding it hard to follow the maths involved in the description of the IFDS framework and graph reachability . I 've read in several places that its not possible to compute the points-to sets of a program using this solver as `` pointer analysis is known to be a non-distributive problem . '' [ 1 ] Other sources have said that this is often specifically with regard to 'strong updates ' , which from what I can gather are field write statements.I think I can basically follow how the solver computes edges and works out the dataflow facts . But I do n't quite follow what this : f ( A ∪ B ) = f ( A ) ∪ f ( B ) means in practical terms as a definition of a distributive function , and therefore what it means to say that points-to analysis deals with non-distributive functions.The linked source [ 1 ] gives an example specific to field write statements : It claims that in order to reason about the assignment to b.f one must also take into account all aliases of the base b. I can follow this . But what I do n't understand is what are the properties of this action that make it non-distributive.A similar ( I think ) example from [ 2 ] : Where before the statement there are points-to edges y -- > obj1 and obj1.n -- > obj2 ( where obj1 and 2 are heap objects ) . They claim it is not possible to correctly deduce that the edge x -- > obj2 should be generated after the statement if we consider each input edge independently . The flow function for this statement is a function of the points-to graph as a whole and can not be decomposed into independent functions of each edge and then merged to get a correct result.I think I almost understand what , at least the first , example is saying but that I am not getting the concept of distributive functions which is blocking me getting the full picture . Can anyone explain what a distributive or non-distributive function is on a practical basis with regards to pointer analysis , without using set theory which I am having difficulty following ?

"Ok , so this is a really , REALLY weird issue that we 're having with the application at my company . I 'm going to try and describe this as best I can.First , this is a legacy application with a Swing UI.Second , the issue only occurs when it is compiled & run using Java 8 . With Java 7 and below , this does not occur.So , the issue : When a dialog is displayed ( modal or non-modal , does n't matter ) , the UI becomes unresponsive to mouse clicks . What 's truly crazy , though , is the UI is NOT frozen . Hovering the mouse over something produces the hover highlight as normal . Keyboard commands are received perfectly . Mouse clicks , however , do not work.This also only occurs on OSX . Windows and Linux do n't have this problem . I 'm running this on OSX El Capitan.As far as code samples , it 's affecting all dialogs across the application . JOptionPanes & JDialogs , does n't seem to matter . Here 's a simple JOptionPane declaration : This code IS being called on the EventThread , so I do n't believe it 's a threading issue.I 'm totally stumped as to the cause of this . So far we 've ignored it by compiling and running it in Java 7 , but at some point as versions progress we will need to deal with this issue more directly.Anyone have any ideas ? Edit : Thanks for the SSCCE Idea . Now I 'm more confused than ever . When I put together a quick frame/dialog demonstration , it worked perfectly . No issues . So I do n't know what it is in the application that could be causing this . Any good places to start looking ? Edit 2 : Wrapped one of the declarations in SwingUtilities.invokeLater , and it worked . Ok ... now what could the culprit be ? It 's still got to be something that Java 8 is compiling different than Java 7.Edit 3 : More weird behavior . I moved my IDE into a separate `` desktop '' than the application it was running , and when the buggy dialog is displayed , i cant switch to that desktop . I can switch to any app on the current desktop , but not to another desktop.Edit 4 : The dialogs in question are being triggered by drag and drop actions .

"This is problem 9.5 from Cracking the Coding Interview 5th editionThe Problem : Write a method to compute all permutations of a stringHere is my solution , coded in Java ( test it , it works : ) ) I agreed with the author that my solution runs in O ( n ! ) time complexity because to solve this problem , you have to consider factorials , like for a word like `` top '' , there are three possibilities for the first letter , 2 for the second and so on ... . However she did n't make any mention of space complexity . I know that interviewers love to ask you the time and space complexity of your solution . What would the space complexity of this solution be ? My initial guess was O ( n2 ) because there are n recursive calls at each level n. So you would add n + n - 1 + n - 2 + n - 3 ... ..+ 1 to get n ( n+1 ) ⁄2 which is in O ( n2 ) . I reasoned that there are n recursive calls , because you have to backtrack n times at each level and that space complexity is the number of recursive calls your algorithm makes . For example , when considering all the permutations of `` TOP '' , at level , 3 recursive calls , gR ( [ O , P ] ,2 , '' T '' ) , gR ( [ P , T ] ,2 , '' O '' ) , gR ( [ T , O ] ,2 , '' P '' ) are made .

"I have a Java typed actor that is responsible for filter/retry logic on an external resource that may be temporarily unavailable . The actor 's fields and common methods are : The actor has several operations that all have more or less the same retry/buffer logic ; each operation has its own [ op ] Wait and [ op ] Buffer fields.The parent actor calls void operation ( OpInput opInput ) The preceding method calls void operation ( OpInput opInput , long currentWait ) using DEFAULTWAIT for the second parameterIf the currentWait parameter does not equal opWait then the input is stored in opBuffer , else the input is sent to the external resource.If the external resource returns a success , then opWait is set to DEFAULTWAIT , and the contents of opBuffer are sent back through the operation ( opInput ) method . If the external resource ( or more likely the network ) returns an error , then I update opWait = updateWait ( opWait ) and schedule operation ( opInput , opWait ) on the actor system scheduler using a delay of opWait ms.I.e .

"I am trying to wrap my head around what the raw memory looks like in different languages when using an array.Consider the following Java code : Obviously the array is holding references , and not objects ; that is , there is a contiguous array in memory of three references which each points to some other location in memory where the object sits . So the objects themselves are n't necessarily sitting in three contiguous buckets ; rather the references are.Now consider this : I 'd imagine in this situation the Strings exist somewhere with all the other constants in memory , and then the array holds references to those constants in memory ? So , again , in raw memory the array does n't look like [ ' h ' , ' i ' , '\0 ' , 't ' , ' h ' , ' e ' , ' r ' , ' e ' ... ( etc ) ] . ( using c-style termination just for convenience ) . Rather , it 's more like [ 'a83a3edf ' , 'a38decd ' ... ( etc ) ] where each element is a memory location ( reference ) .My conclusion from this thought process is that in Java , you can never ever imagine arrays as buckets of contiguous objects in memory , but rather as contiguous references . I ca n't think of any way to guarantee objects will always be stored contiguously in Java.Now consider C : The code above is functionally equivalent to the Java above -- that is , the array holds references ( pointers ) to some other memory location . Like Java , the objects being pointed to are n't necessarily contiguous.HOWEVER , in the following C code : The structs in array ARE contiguously located in raw memory.Now for my concrete questions : Was I correct in my assumption that in Java , arrays must ALWAYS hold references , as the programmer only ever has access to references in Java ? What about for raw data types ? Will it work differently then ? Will an array of ints in Java look just like one in C in raw memory ( besides the Object class cruft Java will add ) ? In Java , is there no way for the programmer to guarantee contiguous memory allocation of objects ? It might happen by chance , or with high probability , but the programmer can not GUARANTEE it will be so ? In C , programmers CAN create raw arrays of objects ( structs ) contiguously in memory , as I have shown above , correct ? How do other languages deal with this ? I 'm guessing Python works like Java ? The motivation for this question is that I want a solid understanding of what is happening at the raw memory level with arrays in these languages . Mostly for programmer-interview questions . I said in a previous interview that an array ( not in any language , just in general ) holds objects contiguously in memory like buckets . It was only after I said this that I realized that 's not quite how it works in a language like Java . So I want to be 100 % clear on it.Thanks . Let me know if anything needs clarification ."

"I happen to read about XSS and how to avoid it . From what I have read , I came to know that we need input filtering , proper handling of application code and output encoding to make the web application somewhat XSS safe . After going through several articles , several doubts still persist . When I tried jQuery.text ( `` untrusted_data '' ) or element.text=untrusted_data , thebrowser seems to be encoding the content perfectly , but I have read somewhere else that client-side encoding should not be trusted and you have to `` always '' encode at the server-side . Why is client-side encoding considered not safe ? Whenever I tried to set value using jQuery.val ( untrusted_data ) or element.value=untrusted_data it seems to be safe enough . So is it really XSS safe or did I miss any case here ? Also , I happen to read somewhere that jQuery.setAttribute ( attrName , untrusted_data ) and setAttribute ( attrName , untrusted_data ) are generally considered safe only if the Attribute Names does n't include URL Context based attributes ( src , href etc ) or Event Handlers ( onClick , onMouseOver etc ) . If that is the case , how am I supposed to set an href attribute by using setAttribute ( `` href '' , untrusted_data ) ? Is encodeForHtmlAttribute ( untrusted_data ) from server-side the right way of approach ? How should I handle dynamic html creation . Consider the below example < div id= '' divName1 '' onClick= '' copyData ( ) '' > untrusted_data < /div > < div id= '' divName2 '' > < /div > What I want to achieve here is to get the text from divName1 and paste it to divName2 's content . The code I wrote above is XSS vulnerable . I can change this to jQuery ( `` # divName2 '' ) .text ( divValue ) So , this will ensure encoding , but as I understood , we say that client-side encoding is unsafe and only server-side encoding should be used . How should I write this to be XSS safe without using client-side encoding ? I am a bit confused here : ( . Please help me out to clear these doubts ."

"I 've run into a really strange bug , and I 'm hoping someone here can shed some light as it 's way out of my area of expertise.First , relevant background information : I am running OS X 10.9.4 on a Late 2013 Macbook Pro Retina with a 2.4GHz Haswell CPU . I 'm using JDK SE 8u5 for OS X from Oracle , and I 'm running my code on the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA . This bug also seems to be specific only to OS X , as I posted on Reddit about this bug already and other users with OS X were able to recreate it while users on Windows and Linux , including myself , had the program run as expected with the println ( ) version running half a second slower than the version without println ( ) .Now for the bug : In my code , I have a println ( ) statement that when included , the program runs at ~2.5 seconds . If I remove the println ( ) statement either by deleting it or commenting it out , the program counterintuitively takes longer to run at ~9 seconds . It 's extremely strange as I/O should theoretically slow the program down , not make it faster.For my actual code , it 's my implementation of Project Euler Problem 14 . Please keep in mind I 'm still a student so it 's not the best implementation : The line of code in question has been commented in with all caps , as it does n't look like SO does line numbers . If you ca n't find it , it 's within the nested if ( ) statement in my for ( ) loop in my main method.I 've run my code multiple times with and without that line , and I consistently get the above stated ~2.5sec times with println ( ) and ~9sec without println ( ) . I 've also rebooted my laptop multiple times to make sure it was n't my current OS run and the times stay consistent.Since other OS X 10.9.4 users were able to replicate the code , I suspect it 's due to a low-level bug with the compliler , JVM , or OS itself . In any case , this is way outside my knowledge . It 's not a critical bug , but I definitely am interested in why this is happening and would appreciate any insight ."

"I would like to understand how Frege List works and how is it possible to use it from Java . While I downloaded the Frege compiler code , I found difficult to understand what a Frege List is from the Frege code.Doing some tests I saw that a Frege List is an instance of the TList class in Java with a special method , called _Cons ( ) , that returns a DCons object . DCons is , as expected , a pair where the first element of the pair corresponds to the head of the list while the second element is the tail , thus another TList . When _Cons ( ) is called on an empty lists , the return value is null . Therefore , to implement a Java iterator over Frege TList , one could write : My questions are : Is my explanation of TList correct ? Is TListIterator correct ? where can I find more informations on what TList , DList and DCons are in the Frege compiler source code ? Are they documented ? A more generic question on best practices in Frege : when you want Java code to use a Frege value , is it better to return Java `` standard '' Objects from Frege code or is it better to directly use Frege classes from Java ? My opinion is that the former is easier to write than the latter but has a little conversion overhead . For instance , a TListIterator can always be avoided by converting the TList into a Java LinkedList from Frege ."

"I would like to instanciate several versions of the same kind of dependency tree/chain which use different implementations for some of the interfaces in that tree/chain . What is the best Guice practice/pattern to use in such case ? Here is a concrete example of my problem.I have a Writer interface which can potentially be a file writer or a std-out writer , which will be situated at the leaf of my dependency hierarchy . Something like this : Another logger interface is used to add a layer of indirection on the writer . For instance : Then there is a client that uses the logger.Now , I would like to use two types of hierarchies in my program : Client - > LoggerImpl - > FileWriterClient - > LoggerImpl - > StdOutWriterIs there a nice way of wiring this up without using a separate Guice module for 1 and 2 ? Ideally I would like to have a ClientFactory class like this : Could anyone come up with a way to wire up this using this factory , or by any other means ? I would also like a solution that would scale to cases where I have a bigger variety of longer dependency trees/chains . Thanks !"
"DescriptionThe input is List < Item > sorted by score , Item looks like : Now I need to select 10 elements which have the highest scores from the array , under these limitations : They should have different poiThey should have different authorThere are at most 3 items from the same category . And the length of any subsequence from the same category should not be longer than 2.If there is no subsequence which satisfies above rules , just return the first 10 elements.What I have triedNow , I directly iterate over the List , and use three HashMap < String , Integer > to store the appearences of each cagetory/poi/author . And I use List < Item > selected to store the result.If there is already a selected element that has this poi , then the new element will be discarded.If there is already a selected element that has this author , then the new element will be discarded.If there are already three selected elements that have this category , then the new element will be discarded.If there are already two elements in the tail of selected that have this category , then the new element will be discarded.ProblemIt works when the input is large , but when the input is relatively small , it does not work . For example , when the input is Item1 ( Category A , Author 1 ) Item2 ( Category A , Author 2 ) Item3 ( Category A , Author 3 ) Item4 ( Category B , Author 2 ) Item5 ( Category C , Author 5 ) Item6 ( Category D , Author 6 ) Item7 ( Category E , Author 7 ) Item8 ( Category F , Author 8 ) Item9 ( Category G , Author 9 ) Item10 ( Category H , Author 10 ) Item11 ( Category I , Author 11 ) Then my solution will beItem3 discarded , because it has the same category as Item1 and Item2Item4 discarded , because it has the same author as Item2the 9 other elements remain.And this does not satisfy the select top 10 elements . The correct solution is discarding Item2 and only 10 elements should remain.QuestionI think my solution is just in the wrong direction . So I 'm looking for other solutions to deal with this problem . Any solution produces the desired output is appreciated ."

We 've had a request come down from above that one particular object composition , let 's say a BasicFoo ( UpBar , Yip ) , use a different algorithm other than the one found in CalcSomething.My first instinct was to say let 's change the IFoo interface so we can move the logic down to the Foo class level , change the constructor to be Foo ( IBar , IYelp , IStrategy ) and then have the Foo objects encapsulate this logic . Unfortunately we 've also been told the design of the architecture stipulates that there be no dependencies between IFoo , it 's implementations and IAnotherClass .

"I am new to the Java world , but am familiar with Ruby . I am trying to write a program that interacts with some third-party jar files.While the libraries seem to behave fine if called from Java , they behave incorrectly when I call them in JRuby . This is a problem because I would really like to use JRuby . For example , the two programs below try to do exactly the same thing but they produce different output : This Java program behaves correctly.I developed the Java program below in Netbeans and ran it by pressing F6 ( Run Main Project ) . The Libraries folder for the project is set to `` C : \Program Files ( x86 ) \Microchip\MPLABX\mplab_ide\lib\nblibraries.properties '' . When I run it , it prints `` pins : 17 '' .This JRuby program behaves incorrectly.I ran the JRuby program below by just typing jruby bug_reproduce.rb and it printed `` pins : 0 '' . I would expect it to print `` pins : 17 '' like the Java program.More detailsThere are about 80 third-party jar files . They are provided by Microchip as part of MPLAB X and implement a simulator for their microcontrollers . The jar files come with MPLAB X and I also downloaded the MPLAB X SDK to get help with using them . I am using lots of undocumented features of the libraries , but I do n't see any alternative.I am using Windows 7 64-bit SP1 . I have the following Java-related things installed and listed under `` Programs and Features '' : Java 7 Update 17Java 7 Update 17 ( 64-bit ) Java SE Development Kit 7 Update 17 ( 64-bit ) Java ( TM ) 6 Update 22 ( 64-bit ) Java ( TM ) 6 Update 29Java ( TM ) SE Development Kit 6 Update 22 ( 64-bit ) JRuby 1.7.3IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 12.0.4Netbeans IDE 7.3MPLAB X IDE v1.70I used System.getProperty ( `` java.version '' ) to verify that both of my programs are running under Java 1.6.0_22 . That is good , because I followed the instructions in the MPLAB X SDK that say `` For best results , use the exact same JDK that built the IDE/MDBCore your code will be talking to . For MPLAB X v1.70 , this is JDK 6u22 from Oracle . '' I only installed JDK 7u17 after I encountered this problem , and it did n't make a difference.I was able to find a workaround to the specific problem identified in the examples , but then I continued my development and ran into another problem where the libraries behaved differently . This makes me think that I am doing something fundamentally wrong in the way I use JRuby.Thinking that a differing class path might cause this problem , I tried getting the java program to print out its class path and then edited my JRuby program to require precisely the files in that list , but it made no difference.QuestionsDo you know of anything that might cause code in JAR files to behave differently when called from JRuby instead of Java ? What version of the JDK does JRuby 1.7.3 use , or does that question even make sense ? Update : SOLVEDThanks to D3mon-1stVFW for actually getting MPLAB X and solving my problem for me ! For those who are interested in the nitty gritty details : The number of pins was 0 because the pins are lazy loaded when they are accessed with PinSet.getPin ( String ) . Normally all pins would have been loaded because the peripherals load them , but under JRuby no peripherals were detected . This is because the periphal document could not be found . This is because PerDocumentLocator.findDocs ( ) returned an empty list . PerDocumentLocator failed because com.microchip.mplab.open.util.pathretrieval.PathRetrieval.getPath ( com.microchip.mplab.libs.MPLABDocumentLocator.MPLABDocumentLocator.class ) ) was returning the wrong thing.Consider the following code , which is similar to what is happening inside PathRetrieval.getPath ( except there it was written in Java ) : If I follow D3mon-1stVFW 's tip and add JAR files to the $ CLASSPATH , then that code returns : file : C : /Program Files ( x86 ) /Microchip/MPLABX/mplab_ide/mplablibs/modules/com-mi crochip-mplab-libs-MPLABDocumentLocator.jar ! /com/microchip/mplab/libs/MPLABDocum entLocator/MPLABDocumentLocator.classHowever , if I do n't add things to the class path , then that code strangely returns : file : C : % 5CProgram % 20Files % 20 ( x86 ) % 5CMicrochip % 5CMPLABX % 5Cmplab_ide % 5Cmplablibs % 5Cmodules % 5Ccom-microchip-mplab-libs-MPLABDocumentLocator.jar ! /com/microchip/mpl ab/libs/MPLABDocumentLocator/MPLABDocumentLocator.class '' The % 5C is actually the code for a backslash . The Microchip code in PathRetrieval.getPath does a lot of string manipulation and does not properly handle the case where slashes are represented by % 5C . If anyone has any further insight about why the % 5Cs are appearing , I would be interested to know , but my problem is solved.Conclusion : Sometimes Java 's getResource ( ) returns a URL with % 5C instead of slashes in it and this is affected by what is on the CLASSPATH . If you want to be safe , add the jar file to $ CLASSPATH before requiring it , like this :"

"As discussed here , javac and other Java compilers may provide code elimination capabilities for if-statements where the condition is a `` Constant Expression '' .How is this affected if my code uses a constant expression that depends on other constant expressions defined in different packages ? For example , let 's say I have the following classes in the respective specified packages : andClearly , if the foo-package is loaded at run-time from an external jar-file , the compiler ca n't technically just assume that Foo.CONDITION will be false and should not eliminate the true-branch of the if-statement.Whereas , if Foo and Bar were actually in the same package , the true-branch should definitely be eliminated ( if the compiler supports code elimination at all ) .Not quite sure how to best phrase this question , but : How `` close '' does Foo need to be to Bar for a constant expression in Foo to also be considered constant in Bar ? Would they need to be in the same file ? the same package ? the same jar-file ? or does it not matter at all ( i.e . would the compiler always consider Foo.CONDITION as constant and use the value found in the build-path during compile time ) ?"
"I know that this question has been asked countless times , but since most of the questions on this subject are 6-7 years old , I was hoping to see if there are any changes in the original arguments for/against this topic as newer versions of JPA came out . I know that this can be seen as primarily opinion based , but I am looking for a list of pros/cons.Some people have argued that the entitymanager is a DAO in and of itself , and that a DAO layer in your application would be redundant . Most people would agree that the EntityManager covers basic CRUD operations very tightly ... but there is a point that we should not be using entitymanager.createQuery ( ... ) inside the service layer.But now with the @ NamedQueries annotation , we can simply add named queries to the model class and maintain a set of custom criteria queries for each entity model . For example , if we had a User class we can have something likeBy storing the custom criteria queries inside of the model classes , we can avoid re-writing the same queries over and over again in the service layer - which makes the DAO layer seem even more unnecessary now . The reasons that I have found to include the DAO layer are now : You can change the persistence mechanism in the future more easily by having a central point that maintains data access ( i.e generic DAO ) Easier time unit testingI was wondering if anyone could contribute to this list as I am not sure if I should be using a DAO layer in my application"

"This issue is now fixed . My shader attributes were not bound correctly.I have got a game , which when ran from the IDE looks like this : However , when I export it from Eclipse with these settings , The texturing is completely incorrect . The textures are still loaded , but they are not wrapping correctly onto the object.The code is exactly the same , as I only just exported it , and I am currently running both windows of the game at the same time ( One working fine from the IDE , one looking weird from an exported JAR ) .I have also copied all the resources from the IDE directory to the folder with the external JAR . IDE directory : Directory I run the external JAR from : Also , I know that the textures are actually loading - They are not wrapping correctly . I know this because : If you look at the plane , you can see that it still has elements of the texture - They are just all stretched and messed up.Same thing with the Skybox . If you look at that , parts are still there , but again , it 's incorrectly wrapped around the OBJ model.If I hit the Q key to render the terrain with a DisplayList ( Wrapping the terrain texture multiple times ) , it shows the texture . Ca n't get a screenshot of this because I ca n't hit Q and take a screenshot.I have checked inside the JAR file , and the fragment and the vertex shader are still there . The correct libraries also appear to be there ( Besides , if they were n't , the game would not even start ) .Update : As I was restarting the game multiple times to check for more information , I noticed that as soon as the display shows ( so I can see the incorrectly-textured terrain and plane ) , the game freezes about 90 % of the time . No Stacktrace , just a `` This window is not responding and windows is closing it '' .The game still works perfectly without crashing when I run it in the IDE.The server for the game exports and runs perfectly . Only the client is the issue.What about exporting could make the game any different than running it in the IDE , and how can I solve it ? Update : So here is my texture loading code : I now have the texture ID of the texture . I then render the object ( in this case the plane ) like this : And , although I do n't think they 're important , my vertex and fragment shaders : Again , I will stress that all of this is working perfectly if the game is running from the IDE . It is just if it runs from an external JAR that the issue occurs.I will be experimenting with different texture loading techniques and methods ( e.g . packing textures into the JAR ) and seeing if anything different happens.Yet another update : So , I sent the game to another person ( They also use windows 8 ) , and the game worked perfectly ! No texturing errors whatsoever ! So now I 'm unsure if the problem is with my PC specifically or something else.For those who wish to try , you can download the game at http : //endcraft.net/PlaneGame and see it yourself ( Please read the instructions.txt - Also , you 'll need a program to decompress .rar files ) .I will be getting as many people as I know to give the game a go and see if they have the same issue or if the texturing is correct . It is completely baffling me that it works fine when I run it from the IDE , but does not work when I export into an external jar , but does work when I export it into an external jar and send it to someone else ! ( another ) Update : I have sent the game to multiple people , some of them are coming across this crash : In the log file , I see this : In other words , the entire issue ( the texturing and the crashes ) are beginning to look a lot like they are related to the shaders ( either parsing information to them , or the actual shader code itself ) .I have also done more testing , and the texturing works fine without shaders using a DisplayList.Here is the code up to the glUniformMatrix ( ) call : Update - So , with one hour left on the Bounty , I thought I 'd add a few more details : As I probably said somewhere above , the game works for some when exported , but not for others . I 've noticed that the game has always worked when ran on java 7 , but with me only me and one other tester on java 7 , this really is n't conclusive.The texturing renders correctly in a DisplayList . The textures are loading . However , they are not being displayed correctly.Even if you do n't know the problem , trying out the game ( ignore the start screen , I need to make a new one ) and telling me the results , as well as your OS/Java details , etc , would be really appreciated.Yes , the mipmapping is correct . I know someone in the comments mentioned it possibly was n't , but I 've tried setting it stupidly high and I do indeed get a very blurred texture.I 've already tried `` package libraries into external jar '' . I appreciate the time taken for that answer , but I did say in the comments that I 've already tried it.The issue may be the fragment shader ( as someone suggested in the comments ) , but I am currently unsure how to test it , nor do I understand why it would work inside the IDE but not outside of it ."

It seems like the lambda code is not able to understand that JSendFailResponse is a JSendResponse.I can get it to compile if I cast validationErrors to a JSendResponse in the map lambda , but then I lose some of the fields on the JSendFailResponse.EDIT : This code also fails to compile : EDIT2 : Here is a simplified example you can copy/paste into your IDE to see for yourself.EDIT3 : I was thinking I understood this issue based on the help I 've received so far , but the following code compiles and works . So the issue does not seem to be that the map and the orElse must return the same type , it seems to be related to paramterization . So , map can emit TypeA and orElse can emit TypeB if its a subclass of TypeA . But they can not emit differing parameterized types of List . List < TypeA > and List < TypeB > do n't seem to be considered subtypes of each other and now that I think about it , they aren't.ResponseEntity < JSendResponse > is a different type than ResponseEntity < JSendFailResponse > . If I were returning plain JSendResponse and JSendFailResponse from the lambdas , that would probably work . But I 'm not , I 'm emitting different versions of ResponseEntity , which are not really related by hierarchy . So I guess it comes down to how Optional supports ( or does n't support ) wildcard generics . I ca n't set the type of the Optional to ResponseEntity < ? extends JSendResponse > , so I am limited to strict type hierarchies.EDIT4 : The above example is incorrect because the types are switched from the original case . I think I get it now , thanks everybody ."

But , the resulting erased path was found to be diagonal.This problem only exists when the image is rotated . It does not exist when the image is not rotated . After further debugging , we have a few assumptions from the above problems : Due to the rotated image , the x and y absolution position is changed . Thus , the path does not reflect the correct path by the touch routes.How can we ensure that the path is still referencing the right path on what the finger is touching even after being rotated ?

In the first link , they first discuss using a volatile variable to signal to the thread that you want to terminate . The thread is supposed to check this variable and cease operation if the variable has a value that means cease ( e.g . if it is null ) . So to terminate the thread , you would set that variable to null.Then they discuss adding interrupts to help with threads that block for long periods of time . They give the following example of a stop ( ) method that sets the volatile variable ( waiter ) to null and then ALSO throws an interrupt.I am just wondering , why would you need both ? Why not ONLY use interrupt ( ) , and then handle it properly ? It seems redundant to me ."

"-509 vs 510I am seeing some kind of altered or erroneous data , with the use of JDBC . So I observe using H2 Database version 1.4.196 on Java 8 Update 151.Here is a complete example.Note how we retrieve the date value three times , first as a LocalDate object , secondly as text , and thirdly as an int year number extracted from a cast LocalDate object . In the text version we can see that the year is indeed negative . Mysteriously the LocalDate has a different year number and it is positive rather than negative . Seems like a bug.When run.ROW : 1 | 2017-01-23 | when as String : 2017-01-23 | year : 2017ROW : 2 | 0510-01-01 | when as String : -509-01-01 | year : 510So there seems to be something going on with JDBC being involved . Note how the year is presented as a positive 510 rather than a negative 509 . I do not understand this behavior.I can deduce that it is an issue within JDBC rather than within LocalDate . See this example code run live in IdeOne.com showing that a LocalDate object does indeed carry and report a negative year.Notice how we do not get converted from -509 to 510 when dealing with a LocalDate only , with no JDBC.ld : -0509-01-01ld.getYear ( ) : -509I opened a Issue ticket on the H2 project ."

"It seems that stroking on sub-pixel coordinates became broken in Java 8.I have three sets of cases , shown on screenshots ( columns represent cases , rows represent different stroke widths ) : Java 7u51 ( 400 % scale ) Java 8u60 ( 400 % scale ) Fill and stroke on the same coordinates . Works as intended , stroked area is larger than the filling area.Stroking is shrunk ( by stroke width ) and centered ( by half of the width ) to be inside bounds of the filling region . This part is broken in Java 8 for 1px stroke , where painting occurs on a sub-pixel coordinate ( first row ) ; 3px stroke does n't have this problem ( third row ) . It seems that 0.5 is rounded up for the 1px stroke.Filling rectangle is shrunk an centered the same way of case 2 . I need this on graphics , which support sub-pixel drawing , to make non-overlapping fill when cells are overlapping . Here you can see that fill operation rounds down 0.5 to 0 , so it 's only stroking problem.The code is below : As I tested , Java 7 does n't have this problem ( tried on 7u51 ) , Windows ( 8u77 ) and Mac ( 8u60 ) too .

"It has recently come to my attention that Java text components use line feed characters ( LF , \n , 0x0A ) to represent and interpret line breaks internally . This came as quite a surprise to me and puts my assumption , that using System.getProperty ( 'line.separator ' ) everywhere is a good practice , under a question mark.It would appear that whenever you are dealing with a text component you should be very careful when using the mentioned property , since if you use JTextComponent.setText ( String ) you might end up with a component that contains invisible newlines ( CRs for example ) . This might not seem that important , unless the content of the text component can be saved to a file . If you save and open the text to a file using the methods that are provided by all text components , your hidden newlines suddenly materialize in the component upon the file being re-opened . The reason for that seems to be that JTextComponent.read ( ... ) method does the normalization.So why does n't JTextComponent.setText ( String ) normalize line endings ? Or any other method that allows text to be modified within a text component for that matter ? Is using System.getProperty ( 'line.separator ' ) a good practice when dealing with text components ? Is it a good practice at all ? Some code to put this question into perspective : An example of what this program saves on my windows machine after adding a new line of text ( why the single CR ? o_O ) : Edit01I ran/debugged this from within Netbeans IDE , which uses JDK1.7u15 64bit ( C : \Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_15 ) on Windows 7 ."

"I am writing an abstract class and I have a variable that should be defined by the sub-class ( in this case it is an int which is used in the super-class ) .

Can anyone tell me if there are any great reasons why one way should be preferred over the other ? Abstract Method : Pros : Forces sub-class to think about this value and choose what they want it to be.Cons : No default value , so even if most of the sub-classes just want to use the same value they still have to implement the method .

"Consider the following piece of code ( which is n't quite what it seems at first glance ) .My question is : In order to be absolutely certain that `` Problem ! ! ! '' wo n't be printed , does the `` value '' variable in the NumberContainer class need to be marked volatile ? Let me explain how I currently understand this.In the first parallel stream , NumberContainer-123 ( say ) is incremented by ForkJoinWorker-1 ( say ) . So ForkJoinWorker-1 will have an up-to-date cache of NumberContainer-123.value , which is 1 . ( Other fork-join workers , however , will have out-of-date caches of NumberContainer-123.value - they will store the value 0 . At some point , these other workers ' caches will be updated , but this does n't happen straight away . ) The first parallel stream finishes , but the common fork-join pool worker threads are n't killed . The second parallel stream then starts , using the very same common fork-join pool worker threads . Suppose , now , that in the second parallel stream , the task of incrementing NumberContainer-123 is assigned to ForkJoinWorker-2 ( say ) . ForkJoinWorker-2 will have its own cached value of NumberContainer-123.value . If a long period of time has elapsed between the first and second increments of NumberContainer-123 , then presumably ForkJoinWorker-2 's cache of NumberContainer-123.value will be up-to-date , i.e . the value 1 will be stored , and everything is good . But what if the time elapsed between first and second increments if NumberContainer-123 is extremely short ? Then perhaps ForkJoinWorker-2 's cache of NumberContainer-123.value might be out of date , storing the value 0 , causing the code to fail ! Is my description above correct ? If so , can anyone please tell me what kind of time delay between the two incrementing operations is required to guarantee cache consistency between the threads ? Or if my understanding is wrong , then can someone please tell me what mechanism causes the thread-local caches to be `` flushed '' in between the first parallel stream and the second parallel stream ?"

I googles but still not able to found any solution.i just started it by adding the UiSettings only getMap ( ) .getUiSettings ( ) .setZoomGesturesEnabled ( true ) ; Will it be implemented by the help of setOnMapClickListener ( ) or something is there to handle the gesture for double tap event for Map Fragment ? NOTE : This question purely on MapFragment and not related to MapView which have already answers Double tap : zoom on Android MapView ? EDITMapFragment which I used in the layout : The class is a controller which is working for the Activity which extends Activity not AppCompactActivity.Also I added marker clustering in the map.Class side : onMapReady : And inside setUpMap I am simply transferring some data in between objects .
"The java documentation says ; Furthermore , a heap pollution situation occurs when the l.add method is called . The static type second formal parameter of the add method is String , but this method is called with an actual parameter of a different type , Integer . However , the compiler still allows this method call . Because of type erasure , the type of the second formal parameter of the add method ( which is defined as List.add ( int , E ) ) becomes Object . Consequently , the compiler allows this method call because , after type erasure , the l.add method can add any object of type Object , including an object of Integer type my question is about the part i made bold . I understand that in line 2 heap pollution occurs cause l being of List references an object of type List . But when add method is called on l reference should n't it expect Number type instead of String as l is reference to ArrayList . Or is it , that after ls=l the space in heap is made of List < String > also for the l reference ? in this case makes sense what java docs says in the part made in bold"
"I 'm trying to use ELKI from within JAVA to run DBSCAN . For testing I used a FileBasedDatabaseConnection . Now I would like to run DBSCAN with my custom Objects as parameters.My objects have the following structure : I 'd like to run DBSCAN within ELKI using a List < MyObject > as database , but only some of the parameters should be taken into account ( e.g . running DBSCAN on the objects using the parameters param1 , param2 and param4 ) .

Java returns an answer in only a few seconds whereas Python can take up to a minute ( on the same machine , of course ) .

"When playing around with multithreading , I could observe some unexpected but serious performance issues related to AtomicLong ( and classes using it , such as java.util.Random ) , for which I currently have no explanation . However , I created a minimalistic example , which basically consists of two classes : a class `` Container '' , which keeps a reference to a volatile variable , and a class `` DemoThread '' , which operates on an instance of `` Container '' during thread execution . Note that the references to `` Container '' and the volatile long are private , and never shared between threads ( I know that there 's no need to use volatile here , it 's just for demonstration purposes ) - thus , multiple instances of `` DemoThread '' should run perfectly parallel on a multiprocessor machine , but for some reason , they do not ( Complete example is at the bottom of this post ) .During my test , I repeatedly create 4 DemoThreads , which are then started and joined . The only difference in each loop is the time when `` prepare ( ) '' gets called ( which is obviously required for the thread to run , as it otherwise would result in a NullPointerException ) : For some reason , if prepare ( ) is executed immediately before starting the thread , it will take twice as more time to finish , and even without the `` volatile '' keyword , the performance differences were significant , at least on two of the machines and OS'es I tested the code .

I believe that the performance issues described in Java Random Slowdowns on Mac OS more than a year ago are related to this effect , but I have no idea why it is as it is - besides that I 'm sure that it should n't be like that , as it would mean that it 's always dangerous to create a new object within the run-method of a thread , unless you know that no volatile variables will get involved within the object graph . Profiling does n't help , as the problem disappears in this case ( same observation as in Java Random Slowdowns on Mac OS cont 'd ) , and it also does not happen on a single-core-PC - so I 'd guess that it 's kind of a thread synchronization problem ... however , the strange thing is that there 's actually nothing to synchronize , as all variables are thread-local.Really looking forward for any hints - and just in case you want to confirm or falsify the problem , see the test case below.Thanks , Stephan }"

"Firstly apologies if I 'm using the wrong term by picking the word 'semantics . ' I 'm a big fan of generics in Java for all the obvious reasons . It helps me enormously as I work with a huge variety of odd bits of code and I often have to go back to old stuff . Today I found myself with a classic parameter misplacement bug which I probably would n't have written in the pre-generic days - they have made me a bit lazy.I 'd like to know if there is a language feature , either in Java or perhaps as a similar concept in other languages , which takes the type safety of generics and extends it to a kind of semantic safety . Specifically I want to help trap the kind of errors which result from putting the right thing in the wrong place.A simple example : Which no compiler will catch . I could subclass Stringmake wrappers to give me a Key type and a Value type , I suppose . I could name my variables to indicate their use ( as I 've done in this example ) . What else ? So my questions are : out of academic interest , what is this concept called and what languages have this feature ? In the absence of any such language feature , what are the best practices to avoid this kind of error ? Thanks"

"I often find myself wanting ( and then usually writing ) Scalaz type class instances for classes in other Scala or Java libraries . To give just a few examples : A monoid instance for Shapeless 's HList gives you monoid instances for case classes with appropriately typed members almost for free.An applicative functor instance for Lift 's Box allows you for example to sequence a list of boxes : A monad instance for Dispatch 0.9 's Promise ( and Promise [ Either [ Throwable , _ ] ] , etc . ) is hugely useful for all kinds of things.An applicative functor instance for the standard library 's Parser makes applicative parsing more concise and elegant . ( I just noticed that Scalaz 7 now provides a monad instance for Parser . ) And so on ... These instances are almost always very general-purpose , and I 'm sure lots of us have written lots of these lots of times . What I 'm fishing for with this question is some kind of aggregator or clearinghouse for Scalaz type class instances . I 'm not sure such a thing exists—I certainly have n't been able to find anything like it—but even just a collection of links to blog posts , GitHub repositories , or other resources would be useful to me.I 'd prefer Scalaz 7 instances , but I 'll take anything I can get ."

"I am working on an android app which interfaces with a bluetooth camera . For each clip stored on the camera we store some fields about the clip ( some of which the user can change ) in an XML file.Currently this app is the only app writing this xml data to the device but in the future it is possible a desktop app or an iphone app may write data here too . I do n't want to make an assumption that another app could n't have additional fields as well ( especially if they had a newer version of the app which added new fields this version did n't support yet ) .So what I want to prevent is a situation where we add new fields to this XML file in another application , and then the user goes to use the android app and its wipes out those other fields because it does n't know about them.So lets take hypothetical example : When read from the device this would get translated to a Clip object that looks like this ( simplified for brevity ) So I 'm using SAX to parse the data and store it to a Clip.I simply store the characters in StringBuilder and write them out when I reach the end element for title , category and date . I realized though that when I write this data back to the device , if there were any other tags in the original document they would not get written because I only write out the fields I know about.This makes me think that maybe SAX is the wrong option and perhaps I should use DOM or something else where I could more easily write out any other elements that existed originally.Alternatively I was thinking maybe my Clip class contains an ArrayList of some generic XML type ( maybe DOM ) , and in startTag I check if the element is not one of the predefined tags , and if so , until I reach the end of that tag I store the whole structure ( but in what ? ) .. Then upon writing back out I would just go through all of the additional tags and write them out to the xml file ( along with the fields I know about of course ) Is this a common problem with a good known solution ? -- Update 5/22/12 -- I did n't mention that in the actual xml the root node ( Actually called annotation ) , we use a version number which has been set to 1 . What I 'm going to do for the short term is require that the version number my app supports is > = what the version number is of the xml data . If the xml is a greater number I will attempt to parse for reading back but will deny any saves to the model . I 'm still interested in any kind of working example though on how to do this.BTW I thought of another solution that should be pretty easy . I figure I can use XPATH to find nodes that I know about and replace the content for those nodes when the data is updated . However I ran some benchmarks and the overhead is absurd in parsing the xml when it is parsed into memory . Just the parsing operation without even doing any lookups resulted in performance being 20 times worse than SAX.. Using xpath was between 30-50 times slower in general for parsing , which was really bad considering I parse these in a list view . So my idea is to keep the SAX to parse the nodes to clips , but store the entirety of the XML in an variable of the Clip class ( remember , this xml is short , less than 2kb ) . Then when I go to write the data back out I could use XPATH to replace out the nodes that I know about in the original XML.Still interested in any other solutions though . I probably wo n't accept a solution though unless it includes some code examples ."

I 'm programming a big game in Java and I 'm trying to optimize the code but also to keep the code neat and well organized . Now I am unsure if I should use the public static field of single classes that have a couple of variables that are used by a lot of instances . For example the class camera has an x and y position that define what part of the map the user is looking at and what needs to be drawn to the screen . Currently I 'm benchmarking with 50 000 units and I have the following options to draw them . 1 : Store a reference to the instance of the camera in each unit and call getX ( ) and getY ( ) when it should be drawn:2 : Supply the coordinates of the camera as arguments to each unit when it should be drawn:3 : Make the x and y variables of the camera class static : I 'm interested as what is generally seen as the best solution and if it affects performance . Perhaps there are more ways to do this I have n't thought of yet ? Thanks !

The Enum implements Readable . Now , suppose we want a method that reads all values of the Enum into a single buffer . That could be implemented as a static utility method in a helper class ( see below ) .Preferably , that method would be declared in an interface , but that could be confusing , since it would n't be immediately obvious that non-Enum classes should not implement such a method . Ideally , the interface could be defined in such a way that the compiler would ensure it was only implemented by subclasses of Enum .

"I 'm making a game that uses an entire planet for its map . I 've tessellated the spherical planet using this technique , and am now adding in camera controls.The sphere is of dimensions 1 to -1 , so each point on the sphere is also a normalized vector . At any one time , one of the hexagonal tiles that make up the sphere is the 'selected ' tile . The player can then move the selection to neighbouring tiles using the d-pad . They can also independently rotate the camera around using the analogue stickI need to do two things with relation to the selected tile and the camera . Firstly , I need to be able to switch the selection to the tile that is nearest the camera . Secondly , I need to centre the camera on the highlighted tileThe sphere sits on the origin , and the camera sits at point ( 0,0,1 ) . The graphics engine only allows me to rotate the camera around the X and Y axes , so to solve the first problem , I use quaternions to rotate the point ( 0,0,1 ) around the x and then y axes to find the point in 3D space where the camera is : I then compare the distances between the centroid of each tile and the camera position , and take the tile that is closest to be the newly selected tile.However , to solve the second problem , I want to do the reverse . I want to take the centroid ( which is already in the form of a normalized vector ) , and find out the rotation around the X and rotation around the Y needed to get the camera to centre on itAt the moment , I 'm rotating the camera back to ( 0,0,1 ) , then getting the angle in the X axis and Y axis between ( 0,0,1 ) and the centroid and using that to rotate the camera a second time : and in selected ( the tile class ) The problem is this does n't work , ( the x axis always seems to be out ) , and I 'm pretty sure it is to do with the maths of getting the angles and doing the rotating Note : the graphics engine rotates first around the X axis , then around the Y : The centroids are all in the correct place , and the camera definitely rotates by the correct amounts , so I 'm sure the problem is not with the graphics engine . It 's also not the re-positioning of the camera back to ( 0,0,1 ) as I 've checked this works by stepping through the programI 've also made a video to illustrate the problem : http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Uvka7ifZMlEThis has been bugging me for a number of days , so any help in getting this fixed would be very much appreciated !

I stumbled across this doc and wondered what that was all about .

IntelliJ IDEA gives an error in the editor saying `` dummy '' is an undeclared identifier ( but nevertheless it compiles and runs ) . I guess that 's an error in IntelliJ ?

"I was going through the concepts of parallel sort introduced in Java 8.As per the doc . If the length of the specified array is less than the minimum granularity , then it is sorted using the appropriate Arrays.sort method.The spec however does n't specify this minimum limit . When I looked up the Code in java.util.Arrays it was defined as i.e. , 8192 values in the arrayAs per the explanation provided here.I understand why the value was Hard-coded as 8192 . It was designed keeping the current CPU architecture in mind . With the -XX : +UseCompressedOops option being enabled by default , any system with less than 32GB RAM would be using 32bit ( 4bytes ) pointers . Now , with a L1 Cache size of 32KB for data portion , we can pass 32KB/4Bytes = 8KB of data at once to CPU for computation . That 's equivalent to 8192 bytes of data being processed at once.So for a function which is working on sorting a byte array parallelSort ( byte [ ] ) this makes sense . You can keep minimum parallel sort limit as 8192 values ( each value = 1 byte for byte array ) .But If you consider public static void parallelSort ( int [ ] a ) An Integer Variable is of 4Bytes ( 32-bit ) . So ideally of the 8192 bytes , we can store 8192/4 = 2048 numbers in CPU cache at once.So the minimum granularity in this case is suppose to be 2048.Why are all parallelSort functions in Java ( be it byte [ ] , int [ ] , long [ ] , etc . ) using 8192 as the default min . number of values needed in order to perform parallel sorting ? Should n't it vary according to the types passed to the parallelSort function ?"

"While writing an answer to a question about JVM byte code offsets , I noticed something in the behavior of javac and the resulting class files that I can not explain : When compiling a class like thisthen the resulting byte code will contain the following if_icmpge instruction : According to the documentation of the jump instructions , the offset ( which is 32768 in this case ) is computed as follows : If the comparison succeeds , the unsigned branchbyte1 and branchbyte2 are used to construct a signed 16-bit offset , where the offset is calculated to be ( branchbyte1 < < 8 ) | branchbyte2 . So the offset is said to be a signed 16 bit value . However , the maximum value that a signed 16 bit value can hold is 32767 , and not 32768 . The resulting class file still seems to be valid , and can be executed normally.I had a look at the bytecode checking in the OpenJDK , and it seems ( to me ) that this is only valid due to the parentheses being misplaced : It will cast the first byte to signed char . Then it will apply the shift , and add the second byte . I would have expected it to beor maybe evenbut I 'm not familiar with the type promotions and possible compiler-specific caveats of shifting signed and unsigned types , so I 'm not sure whether there is a deeper meaning behind this cast ... So does a jump offset of 32768 comply to the specification ? And does the jump computation code in the OpenJDK make any sense in this regard ?"

Then Saving it to the user section of my database . example below . ****EDIT****this is my firebase model class**** EDIT ****Example of what is happening is if i select batman the id returned is batman1 . but if i select Test item it still returns the id Batman 1. if i select Default it returns id default . I 've tried adding a few more items to the database and Depending on the height and width of my custom listviewitem.xml will make a sort of loop .

So from further testing , i can tell you when it happens.. all ids capture correctly until you scroll . this means that as long as all the list items fit on the screen they return the right id . hence why i thought it was fixed with the below answer.i first had the imageview size set to 300dp squared so it was a big list view item hence only 2 items click working correctly . changing the size to 90dp squared made it so the 5 items fit.the list items ids return in a loop from the first 5. e.g clicking item 6 returns id of item 0 , item 7 returns id of item 1 n so on . Yet the position of the list view item and all data inside the list is correctThe first page all work correctly . I 've removed the image view to try to see if it was perhaps the image was too bigThe second page all ids return in a loop from the first page e.g . the item Mario returns the Id for Batman and the item spiderman returns id for DJ Lama"

"I 'm displaying a weather map in a GWT application . I 'm using GWT 2.7 and the GWT wrapper of the GoogleMaps JavaScript API available here ( gwt-maps-3.8.0-pre1.zip ) .I use a tile server to fetch the weather , which updates every 5 minutes . On the 5 minute mark , I refresh the map by setting the zoom to 1 and then back to the original , by triggering a resize , and by removing and then adding the weather layer again.This worked fine . However , recently I noticed that this no longer works : the refresh never even goes to the tile server , so no new weather is displayed . If you leave my map up for 12 hours , you 'll be looking at weather that 's 12 hours old . Previously , the map would automatically stay updated . I have n't changed any of my code . So my guess is that something changed in the underlying GoogleMaps JavaScript API.However , I then created this simple pure-JavaScript example : To my surprise , this still works fine . Whenever you click the Refresh button , the map goes to the tile server and fetches new tiles.So I tried doing the exact same thing in GWT : This should do the same thing as the pure-JavaScript example . Instead , when I click the button , the map does refresh ( I see the weather layer blink ) , but it does n't actually go to the tile server for new tiles.Weirder still , this `` sorta '' works in Internet Explorer : maybe 1 out of 3 times I click the button , the map actually goes to the tile server . But in Chrome , it never goes to the tile server when I click the button.To determine this , I am looking at the network tab of the browser tools . I would expect the map to hit the tile server every time I click the button . That 's what it does in pure JavaScript , and that 's what it used to do in GWT , but sometime in the last couple months the GWT behavior has changed.I do n't think this is a browser caching issue . The problem is not that the map tries to fetch new tiles but gets old ones , it 's that it never tries to fetch new tiles . I click the button , and I see nothing happening in the network tab of the developer tools.Why do I see a different behavior in JavaScript vs GWT ? Why do I see a different behavior in different browsers ? Is the GWT GoogleMaps library doing some kind of internal caching ? Is there a way to disable this ? Why has this behavior apparently changed ? How can I make the GWT map refresh by going to the tile server for new tiles ?"

"I am doing some practice problems for a competition and I have been working on this algorithm like all day . If you want to read the whole problem here it is , but I will give you a short explanation because it is kind of a long problem.Problem : You have to verify ID numbers by plugging the ID number into a checksum . The ID needs to be converted to base-10 before you can plug it into the algorithm . The ID number starts out as letters : Z = 0 , Y = 1 , X = 2 , W = 3 , V = 4I am not having trouble with the conversion from these letters to base-10 , my conversion code is good so I 'll show you the next part of the problem : Part 2 : Once you have your base-10 ID number you need to plug it into the following algorithm : Note : each ID number MUST be 8 digits long , 0 's will precede a number that is not at least 8 digits.So to simplify : What is most important here , is that X is not the operation * ( multiply ) . X is it 's own operation defined later.Note : The most significant digit seems to be d7 but I 'm not sure , the problem is not very clear about it.Here are the definitions for f ( n1 , n2 ) , g ( n ) and the operator X : f ( n1 , n2 ) = g ( n ) = operator X : I assumed mod is the same thing as % in my code , I was not sure if there was another mod operation I am not familiar with.My StructureThis is how I decided I wanted to solve the problem : Convert the base-10 number into int [ 8 ] Put each digit of the int [ 8 ] through f ( n , dn ) Use the X operator to then combine them all together.My CodeHere are my algorithm functions . I can comment them if they are confusing somewhere , but they really follow the algorithm listed above exactly.Now , here is my main ( String args [ ] ) code : Note : You can assume the functions parseBase10 , and toArray are functioning properly .

But the problem is how to decide what number of pixels to skip as image size varies therefore I am unable to decide how to decide the jump parameter.The problem is to decide how many column and row to skip i.e what value of jump should be set.I tried setting Xmx but image size varies and we can not dynamically set the Xmx values.Here are some values -For this I tried finding memory allocated to program : -Following results were obtainedMemory AllocationThis approach failed because the available memory increases as per usage of my code . As a result it will not be useful for me to make a decision for jump.Result ExpectedA way to access the amount of available memory before the loading of the image so that I could use it to make decision on value of the jump . Is there any other alternative to decide jump value ( i.e. , how much I can lower the resolution ? ) ."
"I have met a pretty strange bug . The following small piece of code uses a rather simple math.Edit Using ProGuard can make it go wrong on some devices . I have it confirmed on HTC One S Android 4.1.1 build 3.16.401.8 , but judging by e-mails I got , a lot of phones with Android 4+ are affected . For some of them ( Galaxy S3 ) , american operator-branded phones are affected , while international versions are not . Many phones are not affected . Below is the code of activity which calculates C ( n , k ) for 1 < =n < 25 and 0 < =k < =n . On device mentioned above the first session gives correct results , but the subsequent launches show incorrect results , each time in different positions.I have 3 questions : How can it be ? Even if ProGuard made something wrong , calculations should be consistent between devices and sessions.How can we avoid it ? I know substituting double by long is fine in this case , but it is not a universal method . Dropping using double or releasing not-obfuscated versions is out of question.What Android versions are affected ? I was quite quick with fixing it in the game , so I just know that many players have seen it , and at least the most had Android 4.0Overflow is out of question , because sometimes I see mistake in calculating C ( 3,3 ) =3/1*2/2*1/3 . Usually incorrect numbers start somewhere in C ( 10 , ... ) , and look like a phone has `` forgotten '' to make some divisions.My SDK tools are 22.3 ( the latest ) , and I have seen it in builds created by both Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.Activity code : main.xml : Example of wrong calculation results ( remember , it 's different every time I try it )"
"I 'm writing a code for a deck of cards which shuffles the deck of cards . I tested the code but I do n't really know if it 's actually doing what it 's supposed to be doing correctly ? What do you think ? This is the code for the shuffle method : My output seems shuffled in its numbers but not by the name of the card like spades hearts etc , For example this is my output when I test the code : Like there 's always repeated names . is it wrong since the point of shuffling is to mix it up ? This is the actual question : When playing cards , it is , of course , important to shuffle the deck , that is , toarrange things so that the cards will be dealt in a random order . There areseveral ways to achieve this . One strategy involves repeatedly picking a cardat random out of the deck and moving it to the end . The following code usesthe Random class ( which you met on page 8 of the “ ArrayLists ” section of theonline course ) to perform one such “ pick and move to the end ” operation : To shuffle the deck effectively , this operation should be repeated many times ( say , 500 times ) . Create a new instance method , shuffle , for the Deck classthat uses a single Random object and a for loop to shuffle myDeck . Aftersuitably modifying the main method , use it to test your new code.So my main question is : am I doing this wrong ?"
"I came across an old set of classes dated March 1997 . It was during the time when I tried to learn Java , and it was JDK 1.0.2Interestingly enough , I have both the source files and the class files intact from that time . The sources still compiles and executes as expected , which was really cool . But was n't Java supposed to retain binary compatibility as well ? Well , somewhere along the way , the format no longer holds valid.A Java 8 VM will report ; The offending class is the superclass of the class that I call from command line.One more detail , in those days , Microsoft was still in the Java camp , and I remember that their javac was more compliant against badly written syntax . The Sun compiler would gladly accept `` public synchronized class Abc '' and many other invalid statements . So , there is a big chance that these class files were generated by the MS compiler , and was then run on Sun JVM.Anyway , my question is ; Is there anyone around who has knowledge about the compatibility commitment in the early versions of Java ? Was it a big deal , or was it sacrificed on purpose ? Or was there a decision much later , say Java 1.4 or Java 5 to simply drop JDK 1.0 support ? ?"
"Before anything , let me first clarify that the below thoughts are purely my personal opinions and due to my limited knowledge . I have no intention whatsoever to say that C++ is not cool . I 've been programming C++ for like a year and I think it really has some cool features . Nevertheless , I feel a bit empty and disappointed as I did n't really learn any `` mind-changing '' things from C++ , from the standpoint of a person who happens to have previously learned Java ( as the 1st language ) . According to the many posts I 've read , people prefer C++ as it 's faster . To a programmer like me who have n't programmed time-critical applications before , I 've yet to have a chance to appreciate this . So far , what I 've learned seems to me are all about syntaxes . This is how we write a class in Java , and here 's how to write it in C++ . This is how to do inheritance in Java and that 's how to do in C++ and so on . ( I know , multiple inheritance is cool , but to me , not a mind-changing thing . I think what 's cool is to be able to answer why Java didn't/could n't support multiple inheritance , which is supposed to be more general than single inheritance ) . Somehow to me , all are just syntaxes and my mind has n't seemed to grow after coding C++ , so far . I think my problem it to write C++ programs with a `` Java-mind '' . What I really want is , as many persons suggest , to change my ways of thinking after learning a new language . I 've yet to get to that with my C++ . I can also write a couple of small Python programs . However , I feel afraid to learn more about it as to me , again , it would be just learning a new syntax , a new way of doing things that are just different , without knowing the reasons . I plan to learn C to really get to know things . I think it would be a quite `` involving '' language . Let me know what you think and please give me some advice . PS : Btw , there is one specific question in C++ I want to confirm . In C++ , writing in the following way is not efficient , if I 'm correct : Instead , write it as : as in the first way , the returned values are copied ( when we assign b = compute ... ) and introduce some inefficiencies ? ( In Java , I guess the 1st way is clear in meaning and okay in efficiency as it passes things by reference )"

"IntroductionI have read multiple posts about implementing interfaces and abstract classes here on SO . I have found one in particular that I would like to link here - Link - Interface with default methods vs abstract class , it covers the same question . As the accepted answer , it is recommended to use the default methods of interfaces when it is possible to do this . But the comment below this answer stating `` this feature feels more like a hack to me '' explains my problem.Default methods have been introduced to make implementations of interfaces more flexible - when an interface is changed it is not necessarily required in the implementing classes to ( re ) write code . Therefore , using a default method of an interface just to realize a method in all implementing classes - quote : `` feels more like a hack to me '' . Example for my examination : Classes overview : Item - Abstract Superclass of all ItemsWater - Item which is consumableStone - Item which is not consumableConsumable - Interface with some methods for consumable items ( those methods have to be overriden by all implementing classes ) Combining those : Water is an Item and implements Consumable ; Stone is also an Item and does not implement Consumable . My examinationI would like to implement a method which all Items have to implement . Therefore , I declare the signature in the class Item . Quick edit : I am aware that instanceof might solve this particular example - if possible think of a more complicated example that makes it necessary to implement the method in the first place . ( Thanks to Sp00m and Eugene ) Now I have several options : Implement the method by hand in every single subclass of Item ( this is definitely not possible when scaling the application ) . As mentioned above when scaling the application this would be impractical or highly inefficient . Implementing the method inside of the interface as a default method so the Consumable classes already implement the method which is required by the superclass Item . This is the solution recommended by the other post - I see the advantages of implementing it in this way : Quote - `` The good thing about this new feature is that , where before you were forced to use an abstract class for the convenience methods , thus constraining the implementor to single inheritance , now you can have a really clean design with just the interface and a minimum of implementation effort forced on the programmer . '' LinkBut in my opinion , it still seems contradictory to the original idea of default methods which I mentioned in my introduction . Furthermore , when scaling the application and introducing more methods that share the same implementation for all Consumables ( as the example method isConsumable ( ) ) , the interface would implement several default methods which contradicts the idea of an interface not implementing the actual method . Introducing sub-superclasses instead of an interface - for example the class Consumable as an abstract subclass of Item and superclass of Water . It offers the opportunity to write the default case for a method in Item ( example : isConsumable ( ) //return false ) and afterwards override this in the sub-superclass . The problem that occurs here : When scaling the application and introducing more sub-superclasses ( as the Consumable class ) , the actual Items would start to extend more than one sub-superclass . It might not be a bad thing because it is necessary to do the same with interfaces too but it makes the inheritance tree complicated - Example : An item might now extend a subsuperclass ALayer2 which is a sub-superclass of ALayer1 which extends Item ( layer0 ) . Introducing another superclass ( thus same layer as Item ) - for example the class Consumable as an abstract class which will be another superclass of Water . That means that Water would have to extend Item & Consumable This option offers flexibility . It is possible to create a whole new inheritance tree for the new superclass while still being able to see the actual inheritance of Item . But the downside I discovered is the implementation of this structure in the actual classes and using those later on - Example : How would I be able to say : A Consumable is an Item when Consumable would be able to have subclasses that are not meant for Items . The whole converting process will possibly cause a headache - more likely than the structure of Option 3.QuestionWhat would be the right option to implement this structure ? Is it one of my listed options ? Is it a variation of those ? Or is it another option I have not thought about , yet ? I have chosen a very simple example - please keep scalability for future implementations in mind when answering . Thanks for any help in advance.Edit # 1Java does not allow multiple inheritance . This will effect the option 4.Using multiple interfaces ( because you can implement more than one ) might be a workaround , unfortunately the default-method will be necessary again which is exactly the kind of implementation I have been trying to avoid originally .

"This is basically a follow-up of this answer of mine.Suppose that I am working on custom collector and supposing that the accumulator always will add some element to the collection returned by the supplier , is there any chance that when combiner is called , one of the intermediate results will be empty ? An example is probably a lot simpler to understand.Suppose I have a List of numbers and I want to split it in List of Lists , where 2 is the separator . So for example I have 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 2 , 8 , the result should be [ [ 1 ] , [ 3 , 4 ] , [ 8 ] ] . This is not really complicated to achieve ( do n't judge the code too much , I wrote something fast , just so I could write this question ) .This is irrelevant probably in this example , but the question is : can the one the elements in the combiner be an empty List ? I am really really inclined to say NO , since in the documentation these are referred as : combiner - an associative , non-interfering , stateless function that accepts two partial result containers and merges them.Well that partial to me is an indication that accumulator was called on them , before they reached combiner , but just wanted to be sure ."

I raised the memory limit to 5GB ( -Xmx5g ) so that the garbage collector defiantly would n't start . Nothing changed . I moved things around , but the pattern stays.So what is the pattern ? In the first three times , the bit of code is in a function and I call it three times . In the second three times the bit of code is repeated in a single function three times . So that the pattern is that whenever the bit of code is run multiple times in the same function the time it takes to run the bit of code will shoot up starting with the second bit of code and stay up there after.I did find one alteration that will produce results like this : time : 58729424 nstime : 59965426 nstime : 51441618 nstime : 57359741 nstime : 65362705 nstime : 857942387 nsWhat I did was add a one millisecond delay between the code bits of the second three . Doing that only speeds up the second of the code bits in the block and no amount of delay will speed up any of code bits there after.Frankly , I 'm confused . I ca n't explain this behavior .

Suppose I have a legacy JUnit test suite that includes the following tests : Now assume that Awesome Mocking library relies on Awesome BCEL bytecode generation library which contains the class org.useful.XMLClass and this library has version 1 of XMLClass . Now assume that Amazing Xml operation relies on Amazing Xml Library that contains the class org.useful.XMLClass and this library has version 2 of XML Class . Also assume that version 2 of the class is not backwards compatible with version 1 - so which ever version has higher priority in the classpath - it breaks the dependencies of the other version . Also assume that there are 400 tests that rely on awesome mocking library - so rewriting is not a desirable option . Also assume that some critical business features have been built with amazing xml libary - and it is strongly preferred not to rewrite that . How do you solve this classpath hell situation - apart from running the ant tests ( assuming you 're running them with Ant ) twice with two differently manually ordered classpaths and manually determined test sub-sets ?

"I have a weird problem when drawing strings with some specific true type fonts in Java 32bit on Windows 10.Since Java 7u13 , whenever a character/glyph of the font is wider than 4 times it 's height , it is not rendered at all using Graphics2D.drawString ( e.g . glyph 4001em wide with basic font size of 1000em ) : However , the font renders correctly on a JLabel so after some investigation of the underlying Swing code I have realised that setting the rendering hint KEY_TEXT_ANTIALIASING to VALUE_TEXT_ANTIALIAS_LCD_HRGB makes the text render correctly : It seems that the rendering algorithm works differently after setting the subpixel atialiasig and renders the font correctly.If I switch to Java 7u11 or earlier the text renders without any problems and without setting the VALUE_TEXT_ANTIALIAS_LCD_HRGB.The same happens for any other font with such wide glyphs - for example this random font has such wide glyph for character `` J '' : http : //www.fontspace.com/digital-magic/hdgems5 - it renders ok with Java 7u11 but does n't render at all with anythig newer than that.Setting the subpixel antialiasing VALUE_TEXT_ANTIALIAS_LCD_HRGB just to render the font seems hacky , ugly and is not always possible ( e.g . when usuing third party libs ) .

Are there any tricks to minimize this cost [ Should I print one out of 10 records , or will this cost just as much because of conditional check ] ? Why do I need this ? Well , I am doing fun stuff with Java ( such as `` find a counterexample for Euler 's conjuncture ... 27^5 + 84^5 + 110^5 + 133^5 = 144^5 ( Lander & Parkin , 1966 ) , '' ) . I want to write a program that is both correct and fast ( this counterexample was discovered in 60s , so I should be able to do it in reasonable time ) . While debugging I want to have as much info and possible and I want to find the counterexample asap . What is my best way to proceed ? Print each case ? - Too slow . Let it run overnight ? What if I missed some i++ ?"

"I want to call an abstract method , generateId ( ) , in the constructor of an abstract super class , where this abstract method depends on some fields of the respective subclasses . Consider the following pieces of code for clarity : Abstract class : SuperClassSubclass : Sub1Subclass : Sub2However , the subclass constructors wo n't work because the super ( ) ; must be the first statement in a constructor.OTOH , if I make super ( ) ; the first statement in the constructors of the subclasses , then I wo n't be able to call generateId ( ) in SuperClass .

"In section Run-Time Evaluation of Method References of the Java Language Specification , it is mentioned that : At run time , evaluation of a method reference expression is similar to evaluation of a class instance creation expression , insofar as normal completion produces a reference to an object . Evaluation of a method reference expression is distinct from invocation of the method itself . First , if the method reference expression begins with an ExpressionName or a Primary , this subexpression is evaluated . If the subexpression evaluates to null , a NullPointerException is raised , and the method reference expression completes abruptly . If the subexpression completes abruptly , the method reference expression completes abruptly for the same reason.And ExpressionName and Primary are defined in the method reference expression syntax : I was interested by the highlighted part and wanted to test the mentioned behavior using the below code : However , the line foo ( p : :getName ) does not throw a NullPointerException .

This is a very basic question about the Java optimization.If you have a simple for loop to iterate through an array and use array.length in the header of the loop rather than evaluating it before so that you do it only once ( which is what I almost always do ) : Can the statement be optimized so that the JVM knows whether the array is changing for the duration of the loop so that it does not reevaluate array.length every time ?

I do not understand how low disk space can only affect deserialization and not serialization ? I am using apache commons SerializationUtils class .

"I have a topology in mininet which consists of 2 floodlight controllers ( c1 and c2 ) , a switch ( s1 ) which is connected to c1 and 2 hosts ( h1 and h2 ) that are connected to this switch . I 'm writing a program in which when c1 receives an ICMP packet from s1 , it will send a Hello message to c2.I 'm using this tutorial for this purpose which says : Messages can be sent from one controller to another using the send function , and the messages have to be tagged with an ‘ m ’ “ m ” . You will send this message TO a particular controller so the TO address comprises of two parts IP : port . The IP is the machine IP address of the other controller ( HAServer is listening on all ips ) , and the port is the corresponding listening port of HAServer on that machine . By default , HAServer on controller 1 is listening on 4242 , on controller 2 on 4243 , on controller 3 on 4244 … and so on . recv ( ) function is similar to the send function and you will be giving the FROM address to hear back FROM a particular controller . The from address also comprises of two parts , IP : port . The IP is the machine IP address of the other controller ( HAServer is listening on all ips ) , and the port is the corresponding listening port of HAServer on that machine . Ideally , this function is called after calling a corresponding send ( ) function , otherwise , a connection might not have been established , and it will just return an error.Here is the complete code of my module : But after running this code , when c1 receives an ICMP packet , I encounter multiple errors : What 's the problem ?

"This a follow-up to chrert 's question Generic classes with Collection getter of other types . If you can come up with a better title to my question , feel free to edit it : Following code contains a generic class GenericClass < T > with a method of return type T and another method with return type Collection < String > , which is obviously independent of T. Now , if I instantiate a raw GenericClass ( which I would never do , so this question is more a theoretical question , to help understand what 's going on ) then calling that method in an enhanced for loop wo n't work , because all generic type information seem to get lost when using raw types . But then , when calling that same method in an assignment , it works ( it warns about type unsafety , but it compiles ) .In my point of view , either both should n't work , or both should work .

But I do n't know how to do such lookup . I think that this logic may not be a good one , but I could n't find any useful information on this specific topic . **Edit1 : **Adding more information : The intended plugins would be Jar files contained inside a subdirectory where the main application 's Jar would be located , like this : Application 's folder|- Main_Application.jar|- Plugins |- Plugin1.jar |- Plugin2.jar |- Steve's_plugin.jarAnd so on.What I expect is that the Application will be able to load all plugins inside the folder at runtime . So in the code , it would only be aware that the plugin 's folder should exist and there should be Jars inside such folder.Let 's say I have a plugin interface like this : Plugins would be identified by a class that implements such interface , like soThe Application should be compiled only once , and be able to load any Plugins added to the folder when it is executed.For the Application to be able to load any Plugin , do I need to establish rules on the contents of the Jar , like package name and the class that implements the interface ?

background : I once answered this question that was about flushing two input strings from a Java process to a batch script . Since I found a workaround solution I am still very interested to solve the remaining mystery and find out why the obvious solution is not working.problem description See this very simple batch script : If you run this batch script with Java using ProcessBuilder and flush two input strings into it you will notice that only the first input string will be consumed while the second will be ignored.I found out that SET /P command consumes input from pipes when CRLF token is foundby timeoutby full buffer ( 1024 Bytes ) My accepted workaround was based on the last two options by using a Thread.sleep ( 100 ) statement between the inputs or using a 1024 ByteBuffer for each input . It always works for single input or in this case the first input because closing the stream has the effectthat the batch script reads one input and empty returns all following SET /P statements.the questionWhy is the first option by using the CRLF token `` input\r\n '' not working ? researchI already tried to workaround the String.getBytes ( ) method by creating a Byte Buffer myself using \x0d and \x0a as last bytes for CRLF token but it has no effect.And I tried all other OutputStream wrappers like PrintWriter to check if there is a problem with the flush ( ) implementation without any success.I created a C++ program that basically does the same as the java programm by using CreateProcess and stangely it works like a charm.testing codeNot working Java code : Full working C++ code : the question againThe problem does not make any sense to me and is bugging me a lot . Why does sending the CRLF token from Java does not have any effect on batch file inputs while it does when sending from C++ program ?

In my original program I was working on , it seemed more like 1 in 3 ( I 've completely changed that program now so do n't have it to hand ) . -- -- -- -- EDIT 4 -- -- -- -- -I have come up with a slightly more stripped down version which no longer uses any random values and still produces the visual switchback . It seems to happen more often with this code : A couple of observations : afaict the panels must be overlapping at firstif I use a flow layout , increase the size of the window , or any waythat stops the panels from overlapping initially , then I do n't seemto get the problem ( or maybe it just happens much less often ? )"
I have read source code of java.lang.Number and I wondered why intValue ( ) longValue ( ) floatValue ( ) doubleValue ( ) are abstract but shortValue ( ) byteValue ( ) a concrete.source code : Why java founders have made it so ? I do n't see big differencies between these method . Its seem as related.P.S.from Long class : from Integer classHence we are see a lot of same code . I think copy paste development is bad but I think that Java founders have reasons for this .

"I 'm using the Disruptor framework for performing fast Reed-Solomon error correction on some data . This is my setup : The producer reads blocks of 2064 bytes from disk into a byte buffer.The 8 RS decoder consumers perform Reed-Solomon error correction in parallel.The consumer writes files to disk.In the disruptor DSL terms , the setup looks like this : When I do n't have a disk output consumer ( no .then ( writerHandler ) part ) , the measured throughput is 80 M/s , as soon as I add a consumer , even if it writes to /dev/null , or does n't even write , but it is declared as a dependent consumer , performance drops to 50-65 M/s.I 've profiled it with Oracle Mission Control , and this is what the CPU usage graph shows : Without an additional consumer : With an additional consumer : What is this gray part in the graph and where is it coming from ? I suppose it has to do with thread synchronisation , but I ca n't find any other statistic in Mission Control that would indicate any such latency or contention ."
"While upgrading an app to Java 8 I ran into a weird issue with google guava 's newArrayList in a couple of places.Take a look at this example : In the first example when I get the UnmodifiableIterator first into its own variable and then call newArrayList I get what I expect , which is the Iterators values copied into a new List.In the second example where the forEnumeration goes directly into the newArrayList method I get back a List with a containing the iterator ( which contains the value ) .According to Intellij it thinks that both method calls should be to newArrayList ( Iterator < ? extends E > elements ) but I found when debugging that the second call actually goes to newArrayList ( E ... elements ) .It only happens when I compile with the Oracle JDK8 targeted to Java8 . If I target to 7 it works fine ."

"Consider the program : Is Foo required in the runtime classpath if the program is launched without arguments ? ResearchThe Java Language Specification is rather vague when Linkage Errors are reported : This specification allows an implementation flexibility as to when linking activities ( and , because of recursion , loading ) take place , provided that the semantics of the Java programming language are respected , that a class or interface is completely verified and prepared before it is initialized , and that errors detected during linkage are thrown at a point in the program where some action is taken by the program that might require linkage to the class or interface involved in the error . My Tests indicate that LinkageErrors are only thrown when I actually use Foo : Can this behaviour be relied upon ? Or is there any mainstream JVM that links unused code ? If so , how can I isolate unused code such that it is only linked if needed ?"

"I 'm coming from a Java background , and I 'm trying to wrap my head around Haskell 's type system.In the Java world , the Liskov Substitution Principle is one of the fundamental rules , and I 'm trying to understand if ( and if so , how ) this is a concept that applies to Haskell as well ( please excuse my limited understanding of Haskell , I hope this question even makes sense ) .For example , in Java , the common base class Object defines the method boolean equals ( Object obj ) which is consequently inherited by all Java classes and allows for comparisons like the following : Unfortunately , due to the Liskov Substitution Principle , a subclass in Java can not be more restrictive than the base class in terms of what method arguments it accepts , so Java also allows some nonsensical comparisons that can never be true ( and can cause very subtle bugs ) : Another unfortunate side effect is that , as Josh Bloch pointed out in Effective Java a long time ago , it is basically impossible to implement the equals method correctly in accordance with its contract in the presence of subtyping ( if additional fields are introduced in the subclass , the implementation will violate the symmetry and/or transitivity requirement of the contract ) .Now , Haskell 's Eq type class is a completely different animal : Here , comparisons between objects of different types get rejected with an error : While this error intuitively makes a lot more sense than the way Java handles equality , it does seem to suggest that a type class like Eq can be more restrictive with regards to what argument types it allows for methods of subtypes . This appears to violate the LSP , in my mind.My understanding is that Haskell does not support `` subtyping '' in the object-oriented sense , but does that also mean that the Liskov Substitution Principle does not apply ?"

"This question is about different behaviour of JEditorPane in Java 8 and Java 9 . I ’ d like to know if others have experienced the same , whether it could be a bug in Java 9 , and if possible have your input to how to handle it in Java 9.Context : In our ( age-old ) code base we are using a subclass of JTable , and for rendering multi-line HTML in one of the columns we are using a subclass of JEditorPane . We are using JEditorPane.getPreferredSize ( ) for determining the height of the content and using it for setting the height of the table row . It ’ s been working well for many years . It doesn ’ t work in Java 9 ; the rows are displayed just 10 pixels high . Seen both on Windows and Mac.I should like to show you two code examples . If the first and shorter one suffices for you , feel free to skip the second and longer one.MCVE : Output in Java 8 ( 1.8.0_131 ) : And on Java 9 ( jdk-9.0.4 ) : In Java 9 the first time I set the text , the preferred height reflects it . Every subsequent time it doesn ’ t.I have searched to see if I could find any information on a bug that might account for this , did not find anything relevant.Question : Is this intended ( change of ) behaviour ? Is it a bug ? ? Longer exampleResult on Java 8 is as expected : Output from Java 8 : On Java 9 the second row is not shown high enough so most of the lines are hidden : Output from Java 9 : A possible fix is if I create a new renderer component each time by changing the body of getDefaultRenderer ( ) toNow the table looks good as on Java 8 . If necessary I suppose we could live with a similar fix in our production code , but it seems quite a waste .

"I am trying to create large RDF/HDT files , which in turn means reading large files into memory , etc . Now , that is not really an issue since the server has 516GB of memory , around 510GB of which are free.I am using the rdfhdt library to create the files , which works just fine . However , for one specific file , I keep getting an OutOfMemoryError , with no real reason as to why . Here is the stack trace : I am running the Jar file with the tag -Xmx200G . The strange thing is , when looking in 'top ' , it shows VIRT to be 213G ( as expected ) . However , every time RES climbs to just about 94GB , it crashes with the error above , which I think is strange since it should have more than 100GB left to use . I looked in this question , as the problem seems to be similar to mine , although on a different scale . However , using -verbose : gc and -XX : +PrintGCDetails does n't seem to give me any indication as to what is wrong , and there is about 500G of swap space available as well.The , perhaps , strangest thing however is the fact that the specific file I have issues with is not even the largest files . For scale , it has about 83M triples to write , and for other files , up to 200M triples have not been an issue . I am using Java version 1.8.0_66 and Ubuntu version 14.04.3 LTS.So my question is , if anyone can explain what I am doing wrong ?
