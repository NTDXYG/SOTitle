"I am working on a web application that will make extensive use of AJAX techniques for client/server communication ... JSON-RPC specifically . Zend Framework is being used server-side , and it offers a nice JSON-RPC server that I would like to use.My goal is to architect a maintainable system that exposes a large subset of server-side functionality to the client-side ( javascript ) , without unnecessary code duplication . I 've seen numerous blog posts and tutorials on how to use ZF 's JSON-RPC server ( see here and here ) , but they all seemed geared towards exposing a small , publicly consumable API . Code duplication is common , for example one blog post has the following method exposed : I do n't like the fact that there are two setTitle methods . If the method signature for one changes , the other has to be kept in sync ... seems like a maintainability nightmare if your API is extensive . It seems to me that there should be one Book class , with one setTitle method.My initial thought is add a docblock annotation @ export to methods/classes that I want exposed . When I decide to expose the setTitle method , I just add the annotation rather than a new method.One potential problem I see involves object persistence . Server-side , it makes sense for setTitle to set the object 's title property ... but not persist it in the database until update ( ) is called . Client-side , calling setTitle should immediately affect the database . One potential solution is to modify all accessors such that they take a optional second parameter signifying the modification should update the database immediately : Some sort of proxy class could ensure that the $ persist flag is set for all client-side RPC invocations.Another problem is the serialization of PHP objects . Server-side , it makes sense to do a OO-style $ book- > setTitle ( `` foo '' ) call , but client-side book.setTitle ( 1234 , `` foo '' ) makes sense ( where 1234 is the book 's ID ) due to the lack of state . My solution for this would be to have the aforementioned proxy class be responsible for somehow turning book.setTitle ( 1234 , `` foo '' ) into : I feel like this problem must have been tackled or discussed before ... but I 'm not finding many resources online . Does this seem like a sane solution ?"

"In any web browser executing the following script will result in 'wee ' being sent to the console . In Node it sends { } . I realize that in Node this refers to the exports object in this case . I do know about the global variable , and that is n't what I 'm trying to access . Besides , the script above does not set d on the global object either . Where the hell does it go ? I can access it explicitly by console.log ( d ) ; in the script above but it appears to be stashed away in some nonstandard space for no good reason at all.I also realize that removing the var will declare d on the global object , which is the expected behavior although it seems stupid to have var at the top level scope storing its values in a different place than `` naked '' variables . I mean , is n't the point of the module system supposed to be some sort of digital prophylactic to guard against global pollution ? Here it seems so easy to break the pattern and so difficult to do something standard.d is not declared on the module object either.I do n't have to justify why I 'm asking this question but I 'll answer the first troll to come along with a `` but why do you want to do taht hurr durrrr '' .In the same way that I can differentiate between certain object states of d , I should be able to differentiate the states of the top level scope . In a browser this is the window object , referred to by this in the top level scope . I should be able to asses the properties of the environment before and after script execution to determine a great many things , one of which would be inspection of functions and variables declared in the top scope of an arbitrary script that they may then be applied to the exports object .

This behavior appears to be like that of an anonymous function . In an anonymous function this could refer to the window object , vars would have to be called directly ( as they 're in the anon func 's scope ) and , leaked vars declared without the var keyword could end up at the window object . I have n't yet read the entire manual , maybe this is exactly what is going on but , I was under the impression that each module executed in it 's own context ( window ) and that Node passed messages between module contexts through the use of global and module.exports ...

I have a database ( couchDB ) with about 90k documents in it . The documents are very simple like this : now I want one day to sync this database with a mobile device . Obviously 90k docs should n't go to the phone all at once . This is why I wrote filter functions . These are supposed to filter by `` productName '' . At first in Javascript later in Erlang to gain performance . These Filter functions look like this in JavaScript : and like this in Erlang : To keep it simple there is no query yet but a `` hardcoded '' string . The filter all work . The problem is they are way to slow . I wrote a testprogram first in Java later in Perl to test the time it takes to filter the documents . Here one of my Perl scripts : And now the sad part . These are the times I get : btw these are Minutes : Seconds . The number is the number of elements returned by the filter and the database had 90k Elements in it . The big surprise was that the Erlang filter was not faster at all . To request all elements only takes 9 seconds . And creating views about 15 . But it is not possible for my use on a phone to transfer all documents ( volume and security reasons ) . Is there a way to filter on a view to get a performance increase ? Or is something wrong with my erlang filter functions ( I 'm not surprised by the times for the JavaScript filters ) .EDIT : As pointed out by pgras the reason why this is slow is posted in the answer to this Question .

"When i start my application node app.js , the process running has only 1 thread . However longer it runs the more threads are made for the process . The problem is that when i want to execute specific kind of code like this : It fails because signal was sent from multiple threads and therefore code isnt successfully executed.Simple test , if one do this : it works alright , but this code : wont be executed , because after 2 minutes node will have many threads and they all try to execute code - as a result you will see error : address in use.So despite running multi-thread process of the same file how can i force node to execute this code only once ? 06.11.2017 EDIT -- -- To clarify the problem : What i mean in the question , i dont have problem with resources , if i start all the servers at once ( for example 40 servers ) they are all started successfully and working indefinitely . Problem happens if i start just one server and then run the code that auto starts more when needed . At that point i always see address in use error , ofc obviously address is not in use in the moment of code execution . Currently i have to manually start more servers in weekends when there are more people using service and less servers in other days of week , i wanted to create automated system that starts and closes servers based on population.this is the code of servers starting : now if i execute controller.add_server ( ) 40 times in row it will start 40 servers correctly , but if i do this : I get randomly error at second , third or forth server creation that address is already used.07.11.2017 EDIT -- -- As suggested i tried the following libraries for port scan/finder : portfinderportscannerscan-portsOnly using first one i was able to start at least 2 servers , this is the code i used : After many tests performed , it look like i can start 2 servers and then its random , crashes at third or forth attempt . Its clear that problem is deeper then with ports finding , this library is only telling me what i already know , i know what ports are opened , and i double check that before script will try to start server with manual netstat -anp | grep PORT command.So its clear that problem is not in finding opened ports , from the outcome point of view it looks like node is attempting to start server multiple times from single command.follow up EDIT -- -- adding server_instance.js code:08.11.2017 EDIT -- -- I was testing many solutions to solve the problem and i observed this situation : local test on mac osx where i can generate maximum 3000 connections to server . Error never happens , node has 1 process and 6 threads for router file . With 3000 connections i can generate even 200 servers without any problem.server test on linux debian where i generate 2 mln connections to server . Error always happens on 3th or 4th server instance , when i connect all the people node has 6 processes and 10 threads for every process for router file.This is clearly the source of the problem , the more capacity i have , more processes node spawns and sooner it will overlap when attempting to start new server ."

"I have recently started playing around with Javascript and API arrays , in order to try to understand how to retrieve and work with different APIs.The question of Javascript loops and arrays has been asked and answered several times , both here in StackOverflow and other websites.However , I seem to be unable to find ( Potentially due to my lack of understanding and/or keywords used ) exactly what I am looking for.My current project is to create a WebApp that retrieves information from an API ( I chose the random user API ) and display this information on the screen.Implementation and IssueSo far I have been focusing on retrieving specific data from the API ( which I have succeeded to do , to a certain degree ) and displaying them on a browser.I decided that I wanted to show several users at the same time , limiting it to 15 users shown at a time ( when the browser is refreshed it should show another 15 users randomly ( part of the API ) ) .Although I am aware that I can directly request multiple users , by using the results parameter , I am trying to do this myself via loops so that I can understand how to retrieve multiple information and display them as lists.ImplementationThe HTML file : very basic , it contains a main div and inside the div an unordered list element , also containing an element . I will need to remove certain elements from the HTML file and have the JS file create them via innerHTML method as I move forward.CSS file : very basic for now , focusing on the JS file.The Javascript file : pretty basic for now too . It contains a constant variable with the fetched API URL . It retrieves the data as JSON and then adds specific information ( in this case first name and photo ) in their specified IDs , using document.getElementById ( ) .I have researched methods to retrieving and displaying information from APIs and so far have obtained a basic understanding.However , I seem to have come to a halt ( because I do not fully understand how to use for-loops or map ( ) to go through my current JS code and display the same data N amount of times for N amount of users ) .IssueBefore adding the for-loop , the js file retrieves the required information of one random user , which is what I would expect it to do.However , once my for-loop has been added , it stops displaying anything , and does not provide any error messages that could help me solve the issue.I did try the following for-loop to see if I had at least understood the very basics and printed the results in the console : I have attached the block of code snippets to a JSbin link . There , you can see the current state and issue.Current HTML + JS files and output ( JS Bin ) : In this example I have commented out the for-loop to show that it does work up to a certain point.Visited WebsitesLoop through and pull in a certain amount of dataJavascript for loop not looping through arrayJavaScript LoopsWrite JavaScript loops using map , filter , reduce and find"

"The question : What is the most maintainable and recommended best practice for organising containers , components , actions and reducers in a large React/Redux application ? My opinion : Current trends seem to organise redux collaterals ( actions , reducers , sagas ... ) around the associated container component . e.g.This works great ! Although there seems to be a couple of issues with this design.The Issues : When we need to access actions , selectors or sagas from another container it seems an anti-pattern . Let 's say we have a global /App container with a reducer/state that stores information we use over the entire app such as categories and enumerables . Following on from the example above , with a state tree : If we want to use a selector from the /App container within our /BookList container we need to either recreate it in /BookList/selectors.js ( surely wrong ? ) OR import it from /App/selectors ( will it always be the EXACT same selector.. ? no. ) . Both these appraoches seem sub-optimal to me.The prime example of this use case is Authentication ( ah ... auth we do love to hate you ) as it is a VERY common `` side-effect '' model . We often need to access /Auth sagas , actions and selectors all over the app . We may have the containers /PasswordRecover , /PasswordReset , /Login , /Signup ... . Actually in our app our /Auth contianer has no actual component at all ! Simply containing all the Redux collaterals for the various and often un-related auth containers mentioned above ."

"Before you think `` why is this guy asking for help on this problem , surely this has been implemented 1000x '' - while you are mostly correct , I have attempted to solve this problem with several open source libs yet here I am.I am attempting to implement an SVG based `` zoom in on mouse wheel , focusing on the mouse '' from scratch.I know there are many libraries that accomplish this , d3 and svg-pan-zoom to name a couple . Unfortunately , my implementations using those libs are falling short of my expectations . I was hoping that I could get some help from the community with the underlying mathematical model for this type of UI feature.Basically , the desired behavior is like Google Maps , a user has their mouse hovering over a location , they scroll the mouse wheel ( inward ) , and the scale of the map image increases , while the location being hovered over becomes the horizontal and vertical center of the viewport.Naturally , I have access to the width / height of the viewport and the x / y of the mouse.In this example , I will only focus on the x axis , the viewport is 900 units wide , the square is 100 units wide , it 's x offset is 400 units , and the scale is 1:1Assuming the mouse x position was at or near 450 units , if a user wheels in until scale reached 2:1 , I would expect the x offset to reach -450 units , centering the point of focus like so.The x and y offsets need to be recalculated on each increment of wheel scroll as a function of the current scale / mouse offsets . All of my attempts have fallen utterly short of the desired behavior , any advice is appreciated.While I appreciate any help , please refrain from answering with suggestions to 3rd party libraries , jQuery plugins and things of that nature . My aim here is to understand the mathematical model behind this problem in a general sense , my use of SVG is primarily illustrative ."

"Total noob on ionic/cordova/angular here . Started last week , so I am struggling here . I am trying to upload files from an app ( on iOS ) , which was created using Ionic and Cordova .

I have the following code in my worker javascript file.My main javascript file is all fine , because I tried it out with non-AWS configurations ( plain old console.log ( `` stuff here '' ) ) and it works all well .

"This is a lot to read , but if you read it all , it should make sense.I am working on an app that requires users to highlight text on iOS . The text is separated into paragraphs , with line breaks and paragraph breaks , and I decided I would simply use < br / > tags for the line breaks , and start a new p element for each paragraph . The problem with Mobile Safari is that you ca n't individually select letters when the element you are selecting from is not inline . Instead , trying to highlight text would highlight the entire chunk of the paragraph , as it was displayed block..To combat this , I decided I would replace all new-line characters ( \n ) with an inline element like so : So the HTML would look like : And would output as : Line OneLine TwoI thought , `` Good job , you figured it out ! `` Skip to today , where I found out that this is not the behavior I want . Since the text that the user is highlighting comes from a PDF file which is processed into plain text , there would be occurrences like this : Which I would process asWhich would output asHello there , this is a paragraph andit is continuing onto the next line and this line will continue and be wrapped by the set width of the parentThat 's obviously not good ! Now there 's a whole new `` paragraph-break '' where there should be a `` line-break '' . So , I figured I would make two different inline `` break '' classes , one for a single space , and one for a double space.The double space element would act as the one above is , while the single space element would simply move the content onto the next line . So , this brings me to my actual question : How can I move text onto the next line using an inline-positioned element ? Also , I can not wrap the text in another element , such as span , so I can only use CSS to make an inline line break element and paragraph element.There are a couple of things that I have tried to get this to work . Instead of setting the width of the single space element to 100 % like I do with the double space element , I could instead calculate the width of the container and the width that the text takes up , and subtract the two , getting the width of the remaining space . This would allow me to push the content to the new line.You can test this method here : http : //jsfiddle.net/charlescarver/ksvkk/12/Problem with this method is that while I could determine the width , I could n't determine it for multi-line text nodes . Also , this is n't flexible if the container size changes.A possible idea that I had but could n't get to work was to have the single space element have a 100 % width , and have the text push it so that it would push the newline down to the next line . Like I said , I could n't get that to work ."

"I 'm trying to implement a routine for Node.js that would allow one to open a file , that is being appended to by some other process at this very time , and then return chunks of data immediately as they are appended to file . It can be thought as similar to tail -f UNIX command , however acting immediately as chunks are available , instead of polling for changes over time . Alternatively , one can think of it as of working with a file as you do with socket — expecting on ( 'data ' ) to trigger from time to time until a file is closed explicitly.In C land , if I were to implement this , I would just open the file , feed its file descriptor to select ( ) ( or any alternative function with similar designation ) , and then just read chunks as file descriptor is marked `` readable '' . So , when there is nothing to be read , it wo n't be readable , and when something is appended to file , it 's readable again.I somewhat expected this kind of behavior for following code sample in Javascript : However , this code sample just bails out when EOF is encountered , so I ca n't wait for new chunk to arrive .

I have a 'sidebar ' css class that encloses some text which is a repeating element on a number of pages . On one page ( only ) this text renders as if it has its css visiblility property set to 'hidden ' ( it does not display , but leaves the correct space around itself ) .left Firefox 16.0.2 ; right Firefox 17.0.1Here is the css class : The affected HTML : All pages on the site contain an identical piece of google analytics asynchronous tracking javascript . If I remove this code , the bug disappears . I have checked the code and it is correct . It is used on every page in the site , and all other pages , with the SAME html ( it 's a repeating header ) render fineThe google js code : The bug disappears under any of the following conditions - viewed in firefox 16 ( same user settings and plugins ) , or any other browser . - viewed in firefox 17 / safe mode - remove the google analytics code - replace the following line from the 'sidebar ' class css with ( i.e remove the rotation ) It has nothing to do with plugins and addons , as if I manually disable all of these the bug is still evident.Other pages with the same HTML , same css and the same google analytics code render fine.The problem page is the largest on the site ( ~10KB of optimised/gzipped html with around 160 small images / 880KB to load ) , all other pages are smaller.The body is almost entirely made up of 160 repeats of this elementIf I drastically cut the number of these elements down this also fixes the bug.Any ideas how to further isolate/fix the bug ? At the moment it seems like i 'd have to either sacrifice analytics or redesign the site , both of which seem a little excessive.updateI 've done a lot more investigating , and got it down to this.it 's nothing to do with the google javascript . ANY script , even an empty < script > < /script > will invoke the bug . I am using custom fonts with @ font-face pulled in from a linked stylesheet . If i only use system fonts , the bug disappears.if I move the @ font-face rules from a linked stylesheet into the page header the bug becomes more resilient : it shows up regardless of the presence of script tagsturn off hardware acceleration , the bug disappears.remove rotation from the transform , the bug disappears.reduce the page size ( from 160 images to around 10 ) and the bug disappears.Firefox nightly ( v20 ) does not show the bug so whatever is causing it is fixed in some future version after v17.0.1Here are some sample pages showing the issue ( I 'd avoided them in the original question as I guess that linking is a little frowned upon here ) . Browser cache needs to be emptied between each page view to gauge the bug effect accuratelyoriginal page bug present test page bug presentsimplified html and minimised css to isolate the bugno javascript but one empty < script > < /script > tagThese samples are all derived from the test page : < script > < /script > tag removed bug absentrotation removed from transform bug absentpage size reduced from 160 to 18 images bug absentno custom fonts bug absentinternal stylesheet for custom fonts bug presentthis is a weird one . If the @ font_face stylesheet is external , the bug only shows if a < script > < /script > tag is present . If the @ font_face rules are moved to an internal stylesheet , the bug is also evident in the absence of < script > < /script > tags.I ca n't seem to eliminate the bug without changing the design of the page to such a degree I 'd have to redesign the site which seems a little OTT for one version of one browser . I am hoping for a more practical workaround . I tried using jQuery browser sniffing but as javascript seems to introduce the bug that 's a non-starter.update 2Now I have had a chance to test on a different machine , and find the bug is manifest very rarely . Testing as a new user on the original machine does n't display the bug at all . So it is clearly something to do with user settings and - hopefully then - fairly rare . update 3 Following a suggestion by @ Boris , I have tried incremental rotation to see where and how the page is breaking up . It is fine from rotate ( 0deg ) until about 80deg , after which it starts to fall apart . I 've added 1px borders to all elements to help isolate the issue ... sample pages showing 0-90deg ( they should bounce from one to the next on auto refresh ) .This is using -moz-transform so only worth looking at in Firefox . animation : this is the result I am getting in firefox 17.0.1update 4answering some suggestions from @ arttronics - here is a 3d firefox view showing how it should stack up ( when I switch to 3d view , the bug disappears , as if Firefox is trying just that little bit harder to do the right thing ) . the protuding content seen in the 3D view is for text alignment , it does not affect the bug - see this cut-down version ; zoom is reset , no change ; a new user profile exhibits same behaviour.update 5 – reset FirefoxAfter performing a Firefox reset ( as per @ arttronics ' answer ) the bug is still here , albeit perhaps a little less resilient . Prior to reset this would invoke the bug- clear the cache- refresh the page Post-reset , clearing the cache and refreshing brings up the bug about 50 % of the time . If I clear the cache , restart firefox , return to the page - it is still there , every time.Ok I 'm going to answer my own question ... I have not found a solution , but thanks to the interest and amazing efforts of the stack overflow community it seems fairly clear to me that ... this may be an issue that is very hard to replicate beyond the peculiarities of my user setupit 's an obscure bug only manifest in Firefox 17.0.1 and apparently fixed in Firefox 18there is no workaround that does n't involve a site redesignTherefore , in the interests of moving on with other issues , I suggest we put this question to rest !

"I 'm after normalized/canonical urls for SPA with ExpressJS server . Although it is SPA that is backed up by server side router - templates can differ a bit for app urls . One of the differences is < link rel= '' canonical '' href= '' https : //example.com { { originalPath } } '' > tag . Not the relevant detail but explains the context of the question . I expect that there will be only one URL that responds with 200 , its variations are redirected to it with 301/302 ( works for living humans and search engines ) .I would like to make the urls case-sensitive and strict ( no extra slash ) , similarly to Router options , but non-canonical urls ( that differ in case or extra slash ) should do 301/302 redirect to canonical url instead of 404.In most apps I just want to force the urls for * routes to be lower-cased ( with the exception of queries ) , with no extra slashes . I.e . app.all ( '* ' , ... ) , and the redirects are : But there may be exceptions if the routes are defined explicitly .

"I am using Selenium WebDriver to get the content of a site . ( Note : the site has no API . Wish it did . ) The site uses AJAX to dynamically load content when the user scrolls . To get that content , I 've been using Javascript to scroll down and then trying to access the content using findElements ( ) .To be clear about the setup , the page contains several nested elements , one of which is a div with the `` GridItems '' class ( no name or id ) . This div contains many child elements with the `` Item '' class ( again , no name or id , just the class ) . I want to get every element with class `` Item '' in the div . About 25 items are accessible when the page first loads ( not necessarily visible in the current window , but available in the DOM ) , and scrolling down loads more.My main issues are as follows : first , I want to stop scrolling when I get to the bottom . However , I ca n't figure out what stopping condition to use . How can I determine when I 've reached the bottom of the page ? Window.scrollheight wo n't work , because that will give the height of the existing window , not what it will be after it 's finished adding more content . I 've thought of testing if an element at the bottom of the page is visible/clickable , but if it 's not , it may be just because it has n't loaded yet , not because it has n't been reached . Even using a Wait may not work because if it times out , I do n't know if it 's because it has n't reached the bottom , or just because it 's taking a long time to load.The second problem is that when I scroll down , it loads some more elements , but eventually , scrolling down loads more from the bottom and drops the top ones of the DOM . This means that I ca n't just scroll down to the bottom and then use findElements ( ) to get all Items , because many of the first ones will be gone . I know how many items to expect , so currently , I 'm doing the following : That is , I scroll the page three times , get all elements available after the scrolling , and add them to a list . I repeat this until there are more elements in the list than I was expecting to be found.The problem with this is that since scrolling adds a different number of items to the DOM each time , there is often overlap between what is added to the allitems list at each iteration . The Elements are just objects with unique ids an contain no information about the actual HTML , so I ca n't check if they 're duplicated . I may also lose some items if the scrolling does n't overlap perfectly . Also , since I 've scrolled down , the earlier items in the list that have fallen off the top lose their connection to the DOM and then I get a StaleElementReferenceException when I try to process them.I can process each item as I get it , I suppose , though it will make the code clunky . This will also allow me to check its actual content and find the duplicates . I 'm not sure that this will ensure that I do n't skip any.Does anyone have any suggestions for how best to do this ? Am I missing something very important/obvous here ? The other questions here on SO about AJAX content loading address somewhat different problems . ( e.g . I generally do n't have an issue with content not loading and having to wait for it , though I did include a Wait . ) It seems that there should be a better way of doing this - is there ? Sorry for the long-winded post ; I hope it was clear.Thank you so much , bsgEdit : I realize that the accepted answer only answers part of the question . For the rest of it , I found that scrolling down one screen at a time and getting all new elements each time meant that I did n't lose any . After each scroll , I got all elements loaded and did some processing to save the content of each one . This introduces a lot of redundancy , which I used a HashSet to eliminate . I stop scrolling when I reach the bottom , as determined by the code in the accepted answer . Hope this helps ."

"On my web page I have two divs , A and B : The DOM looks as follows ( simplified ) . The main thing to note here , is that the divs are on the same level in the DOM hierarchy and they are not ordered by anything . Also , the outer div does not only contain A and B but also more divs C , D , E etc . B may not necessarily be overlapped by A . It could also be C , lying behind A.A click handler is attached to the outer div , capturing mouse click events on A or B in the bubbling phase . A click into the intersection of A and B will cause an click event on A which bubbles up to my click handler that is now fired . Now the problem : Under certain conditions the handler decides that the event should not be handled by A but should belong to B . If an event should be handled by B , the same click handler will be fired , but the event objects currentTarget property will be B instead of A.How can I achieve this ? I 've already looked at css3 pointer-handler and some event dispatching methods in JS , but could not really come up with a solution here.Possible solution 1 ( not cross-browser compatible ) ? : I think i might be possible to use the pointer-events css3 property . If the handler decides that the event should be handled by B , it sets the pointer-events to none . Then , it retriggers the mouse click . Question here : Is it possible to retrigger a mouse click with only the coordinates , not specifying a specific element ? Anyway , the support of pointer-events is limited : http : //caniuse.com/pointer-events"

"I tried to experiment with parallax and started from scratch to understand the core parts of this magic . To give you an example that I like to use as inspiration , you can see it at this link here at the `` Photos '' section . Latest code is down the page with related information . To get an overall look of the question see the rest of the details.Core parts I already know are the scrollTop ( ) of the $ window and the offsetTop of the element are important to apply the parallax effect on a DOM element as well as a factor for how sensitive the effect should be respond to the scroll speed . The end result should be some formule that will calculate the translateY or translate3d coordinates in pixels or percentage . I read on the internet that the CSS property translate is faster than , for example , top from position : absolute , and my preference would be also to use translate in combination with TweenMax GSAP . So the movement of the parallax will be very smooth . But if only the css property translate is enough that 's fine too . I saw some examples that where using TweenMax , so that 's why I use it for now.JSI have code the basic things : So I 've code above code , but it does n't do anything , of course . See CodePen from above code here . It will only console log scrollTop and offsetTop . As mentioned before , I only know the core parts like scrollTop and offsetTop to apply the parallax effect . Then there should be some area created where the parallax effect will be triggered and happen , so calculations will be only done for elements within the viewport in order to keep the performance good . After that there should be some math done , but does n't know exactly what or how to achieve this . Only after I have a final number , I could use it within for example TweenMax from Greensock like so : TweenMaxParallax formulaIf I look around to get the formula down I came to something like this ( founded on the internet ) : But if I am honest , I does n't know what this does exactly , or why it should/could be this way . I would like to know this , so I can understand the whole process of making parallax happen . The functions of scrollTop ( ) , offsetTop and $ ( window ) .height ( ) are clear for me , but what the trick behind the formula is , is the part that I does n't understand . UpdatesUpdate 1 @ Scott has notified that the inspiration site uses a plugin called scrollmagic.io , but I am very curious about how I can create a parallax by myself without the use of a plugin . How it works and how to achieve it . With emphasis on the formula , why I should it do this or that way and what exactly will be calculated , because I do n't understand it and really wan na know this , so that I can use this knowledge in the future when applying a parallax effect . Update 2I tried to figure out what the following code snippet exactly does . I talking about this one : After some good debug sessions I think that I 've the clue . So scrollTop is the amount of pixels that you 've scrolled down the page and that are hidden from the view . offsetTop is the start position of the element within the DOM and $ ( window ) .height is the viewport height - the part that is visible in the browser - . This is what I think that this formula does : Set the zero point to the point where the element starts . For example , when scrollTop is equal to 0 and the element starts at 240px from the top , then the formula is : 0 minus 240 is -240 . So the current scroll position is below zero point . After scrolling 240px down , the formula will output 0 because of course 240 minus 240 is 0 ( zero ) . Am I right ? But the part that I does n't understand yet is why + win.height . If we go back to above formula ( at Update 2 ) and scrollTop is zero then the $ ( window ) .height is the space from 240px till the bottom of the viewport . When scrolling down , the amount of pixel will grow on scroll , that makes no sense to me . If someone can explain what could have been the purpose of this would be fine . 'm very curious . The second part of the formula to calculate the parallax offsetPercent I still do n't understand . In general the calculation of the parallax strength on scroll . Update 3 / 4Advised by @ Edisoni , I walked the last few days by the videos of Travis Neilson and I have become a lot wiser on the basic functionalities of parallax . A must for everyone who wants to dig in parallax . I 've used the new knowledge about parallax to get my above script work : However , the script works only for a certain part of the elements . The problem is that it only works for the first two elements . I have a suspicion that the `` error '' is located in particularly after the AND & & sign in the if statement , but ca n't get the error solved . http : //codepen.io/anon/pen/XKwBABWhen the elements , that work on the trigger are animated , they will be jumping some pixels to the bottom , do n't know how to fix this to . The jumping to : 1.135 % , after the trigger is fired . So it does n't start at 0 % . I already checked if I should add the CSS property translate to the CSS and set the type of number to % , but this does n't work for me . Should I use the TweenMax .fromTo ( ) function instead of using the .to ( ) function so I can set the start position as well or is my thought about this wrong and has a different cause ? Something like this : Beside that I trying to recreate the effect of the site that I would like to use as inspiration source without the use of the scrollMagic plugin , but I do n't really know how this works , with the use of two different objects that are animated.At last , if someone thinks the code can be better formatted , do n't hesitate , I would like to hear your suggestionsMy actual questions are for update 2 and 3/4 : How to calculate the parallax y coordinates to get `` the magic '' done ? Am I right about update 2 , that the zero point will be reset to offsetTop of each element ? Why my code only works for the first two elements and why they jumping some pixels down if the inline style of translate will be added to the animated element ? See update 3/4 for all info ."

So here it must internally compare references with each other , right ? Can some ECMAscript spec genius confirm that or even better link me some material about that ?

"CLEAN SOLUTION FOUNDI found a very clean solution which really renders this whole question pointless , and I am certain it existed when I asked this question ... I was much to ignorant too look for it.Using attachTo : 'top ' in the PageMod constructor only attaches the script to the top-level documents and not to any iframes.So , if you find that PageMod is attaching multiple times for your add-on , it is probably due to it being attached to iframes , along with the top level tab document . Add attachTo : 'top ' as a property for the object passed to the PageMod constructor , and you would n't need to worry about iframes.For the question below , the solution would beOf course , without @ Noitidart 's help , I never would have pinpointed the reason to be iframes.OLD QUESTIONI 'm trying to write an add-on for Firefox which modifies the pages of a particular website . I thought PageMod was the perfect option for that , but I 've run into some problems . The workers seem to be attaching to the same URL multiple times ( 4 to 2 ) , and I have n't got a clue why this would be happening . I tried the following code in the add-on 's main.js : On running this code and opening https : //www.websitename.net in a single , solitary tab , the console had 2 to 4 instances ofWhich means that the same page has multiple workers attached to it . I do n't know why this is happening , I certainly do n't want it to because I intend to later use the _workers array to communicate with the attached scripts.EDIT : Thanks to @ Noitidart , I 've now confirmed that of the multiple workers , only one is the actual page and the others are iframes , which is why the DOM content available to the content scripts for each worker was different.The question still stands , though . How to ensure that the workers ( and thus , the content scripts ) are not attached to the iframes ? I could ensure that the worker that is n't attached to an iframe is the one pushed to _workers , but is there a way to attach a content script to a worker once I 've ensured it is the correct one ? I do n't want the rather large content script to be attached multiple times.EDIT 2 : Again , thanks to @ Noitidart , I think I have somewhat of a solution : destroy if worker is detected to be attached to an iframe . A better solution would be to only attach the main content script to the correct worker , but presently I have been unable to find a way to attach a content script to the correct worker ( worker.contentScriptFile = data.url ( `` file.js '' ) does n't seem to work ) .So , the current hack : verify.js : main.js : I should note that the order in which the scrips appear in contentScriptFile does n't matter , both scripts are loaded for each attachment . So no point hoping that verify.js destroys the worker before my_main_script.js is loaded.And again , this solution is not complete . If I have n't emphasized enough on this point , I really hope there 's a way to attach my_main_script.js to the correct worker , instead of having it load for all workers .

"I have to process loads of images . First , I need to check if the size of the image is greater than 50x60 and appropriately increasing the counter of bad images.The problem I have is that the speed of n.width / n.height on Internet Explorer 8 is extremely low . I checked n.offsetWidth , n.clientWidth but they are all the same speed-wise . I can not use n.style.width though , because this value is not always set on the < img / > tags that I 'm interested in.Consider following code : JavascriptHTMLCode produces following output parsing 10k images ( 3 different Ctrl+F5s ) FF : Processed 10000 images in 115ms . 10000 were marked as bad.FF : Processed 10000 images in 99ms . 10000 were marked as bad.FF : Processed 10000 images in 87ms . 10000 were marked as bad.IE8 : Processed 10000 images in 206ms . 10000 were marked as bad.IE8 : Processed 10000 images in 204ms . 10000 were marked as bad.IE8 : Processed 10000 images in 208ms . 10000 were marked as bad.As you can see the code in FF 3.6 is twice faster than the code executed in IE8 . To prove that the issue is really related to the speed of browser dimension property , if I change : n.width and n.height to constants , so we 'll have : I get following results : FF : Processed 10000 images in 38ms . 10000 were marked as bad.FF : Processed 10000 images in 34ms . 10000 were marked as bad.FF : Processed 10000 images in 33ms . 10000 were marked as bad.IE8 : Processed 10000 images in 18ms . 10000 were marked as bad.IE8 : Processed 10000 images in 22ms . 10000 were marked as bad.IE8 : Processed 10000 images in 17ms . 10000 were marked as bad.That 's right ! When we skip < img / > dimension check ( call to node.width / node.clientWidth etc ) , IE8 actually performs better than Firefox.Do you have any ideas why does it take so long for IE to check the size of the image and eventually how to improve the performance of this check ?"

"I 've seen many tutorials on the new EMCA promises advocating avoidance of the `` promises '' in the jQuery library .

"TL ; DR : How to force drawing datatable when it is on inactive tab but its input changes ? A have a shiny app which looks like that : My problem is the following : When the input ( input $ random_value ) changes while the tab test_render ( i.e. , the one with DT ) is open , everything works properly . However , when the tab containing DT is not active while the user changes its input , DT does not get updated , even though suspendWhenHidden = FALSE is set and renderDT seems to be called.I have found an open issue complaining about similar problem but no solution was offered . I have also found this question and tried to adapt it to my problem . So far I am successful with updating DT by running $ ( `` # dt_test table '' ) .DataTable ( ) .draw ( ) ; from browser console . DT also gets updated when it is clicked ( e.g. , on the sort button ) .I am looking for a way to update DT immediately on input changes ( or its initialization ) , no matter if it is on active panel or not . A special case of this problem that is especially troublesome is when the app is started -- DT is not rendered immediately . It seems the drawing starts only when the tab on which it 's located is opened ( it shows Processing ... ) . In my actual app this introduces couple of seconds lag -- that 's why I want to force processing DT while the user is looking at some other tab.I experimented with including a javascript file that runs $ ( `` # dt_test table '' ) .DataTable ( ) .draw ( ) ; on various events but so far without success.Is there a way to achieve what I am looking for with the aforementioned events or any other method ?"

"Edit : For simplicity , and in order to try and make this question and the sample code more generic , I left out a detail . A detail which , in light of one of the responses ( which was great ) , turns out to be important . This system will be used primarily to show things within a date range . The low/high numbers in the code will often represent Unix timestamps the range of which could span weeks or months . End EditI have a page where I provide a view of data objects which have properties that fall within a certain range . As the user interacts with the view to change it , it generally is a sequential change to the range ( 0-9 , 10-19 ... ) . I am retrieving this data from the server , and as it comes in I cache it such that a subsequent request for data in that range is already available . On each read of the data , I first check to see if I have the cache data , and if not I read it from the server and adjust the cache.A crude , overly simplified example is here : This works great as long as the change in range really is sequential . However , I realized there is a way to change the view non-sequentially and skip a large set of values . So Let 's say I am currently showing for ranges 10-19 , and I have a cache holding for ranges 0-29 . Then the user asks for a view of data for range 60-69 . The way it currently works , I 'll ask the server for data and get it back and present it fine . But now the cache rangeLow and rangeHigh run from 0-69 while it only actually holds data for ranges 0-29 and 60-69 . Items with properties ranging 30-59 are not in the cache and will never be retrieved.What ( better , efficient ) mechanism or algorithm can I use to store cached information and determine whether my current displayed range is in the cache ?

"I 'm a Ruby/Rails developer now working at a Python/Django shop . I 've started to warm up to Python , however , I 'm still struggling to find Django comparable to Rails in certain aspects I find important . A lot of my current and future work will focus on making AJAX requests to our API . As a Rails developer , I 'd have used unobtrusive javascript and in particular on form submissions added a data-remote tag , as shown below.I 'd then write a method in the controller to handle the request and would have written a JavaScript/jQuery function using event delegation in a JS file located in the /assets/js directory to handle the response on the client-side . I assumed coming over to Django there would be a similar way of implementing this sort of functionality.What I guess I 'm really trying to say is I assumed Django would offer similar `` magic '' to Rails in terms of not having to write out jQuery AJAX functions every time I wanted to make an AJAX request . I wrote a rough comparison ( very rough ) of how I 'd write both of these out . I 'm looking to learn if this is an incorrect approach to what I would do in Rails in Django . I know StackOverflow is n't meant for opinions , but I think breaking principles that apply no matter what language/framework you 're using , i.e . DRYing up code by not writing out AJAX functions over and over , is n't really going against an opinion , its more like breaking an accepted rule.My current approach to working with AJAX requests in Django feels wrong , or maybe I 'm just used to the `` magic '' Rails offers via the data-remote= '' true '' attribute . Would love some guidance on the topic to help me determine a solid approach , thanks .

I was thinking of this : Here is some code I wrote : However , for some reason this is not working . I have not found a way to include a tooltip .

Update1 : @ user5325596 pointed out that my display property for the detail div was set to none , so I fixed that by adding the following : right after $ ( '.common ' ) .hide ( ) .

"I wish to run an function ( in the background ) using a worker . The data comes from a http request . I am using a mock calculation ( e.data [ 0 ] * e.data [ 1 ] * xhrData.arr [ 3 ] ) ( replaced by a function returning the actual algo result ) as below : This works fine . But , this is a pure JS implementation . I was planning to use a service ( plus a shared worker ) for this so I create only one worker per angular app and dont have memory issues . This is going to be a trigger from a user button action of form submit.My question : First , I am wondering if this can be done by service workers in Angular itself since it is also a type of background worker thread.Second , If not possible then can I access the cache of service workers from web worker ? and Is it possible to access this service worker cache . How is this supposed to be done ? Any help is welcome.Note that I am able to work with service workers and I am able to cache all static assets using angular service workers.Update : I was able to get some basic idea of enabling data cache in the angular app using following config which I am currently working on.Update : I was able to get this up and running in a crude but it worked . Added the asset that needed the XHR request into the ngsw-config.json in the assets section . This cached the request into service worker cache . The service workers cache can be opened using caches.open ( 'ngsw : db : $ { name } ' ) but I did not have to do that.Here is how I achieved that . I created a service in angular for the service worker : Then I created a web-worker.js file in the assets folder : My ngsw-config.json had assets section which cached assets/test.md : From the component , say for example , app.component.ts I triggered a postMessage ( ) This makes the web-worker.js trigger the XHR request . Though I was expecting I will have to use a cache access api my self , it was not so . The service worker automatically served the file from the cache ( Which is fantastic ) . However if there is a need to access the cache I found this can be done using the cache API here : https : //developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheI am sure things can be bettered and file structuring can be made cleaner as per best practices . If you find a better solution please leave an answer so it helps everyone ."

"I 've read a few articles that suggest extending the built-in objects in JavaScript is a bad idea . Say for example I add a first function to Array ... Great , so now I can get the first element based on a predicate . But what happens when ECMAScript-20xx decides to add first to the spec , and implement it differently ? - well , all of a sudden , my code assumes a non-standard implementation , developers lose faith , etc.So then I decide to create my own type ... So now , I can pass an array into a new Enumerable , and call first on the Enumerable instance instead . Great ! I 've respected the ECMAScript-20xx spec , and I can still do what I want it to do.Then the ES20XX+1 spec is released which introduces an Enumerable type , which does n't even have a first method . What happens now ? The crux of this article boils down to this ; Just how bad is it to extend the built in types , and how can we avoid implementation collisions in future ?

"The patterns of promises usage still confuse me.For example , in Angular application , I have a service usersService with method emailExists ( email ) .

So , by now , I ended up with this rather ugly code : It makes me think that I should modify my service so that it returns resolved/rejected promise instead .

"I have recently learned that you can use a neat switch statement with fallthrough to set default argument values in Javascript : I have grown to like it a lot , since not only is it very short but it also works based on parameters actually passed , without relying on having a special class of values ( null , falsy , etc ) serve as placeholders as in the more traditional versions : My inital though after seeing the version using the switch was that I should consider using it `` by default '' over the || version.The switch fallthough makes it not much longer and it has the advantage that it is much more `` robust '' in that it does not care about the types of the parameters . In the general case , it sounds like a good idea to not have to worry about what would happen with all the falsy values ( `` , 0 , null , false ... ) whenever I have to make a function with default parameters.I would then reserve the arg = arg || x for the actual cases where I want to check for truthyness instead of repurposing it as the general rule for parameter defaulting.However , I found very few examples of this pattern when I did a code search for it so I had to put on my skeptic hat . Why did n't I find more examples of this idiom ? Is it just now very well known ? Did I not search well enough ? Did I get confused by the large number of false positives ? Is there something that makes it inferior to the alternatives ? Some reasons that I ( and some of the comments ) could think of for avoiding switch ( arguments.length ) : Using named parameters passed via an object literal is very flexible and extensible . Perhaps places where more arguments can be optional are using this instead ? Perhaps most of the time we do want to check for truthyness ? Using a category of values as palceholders also allows default parameters to appear in the middle instead of only at the end : myFunc ( 'arg1 ' , null , 'arg3 ' ) Perhaps most people just prefer the very short arg = arg || `` default '' and most of the time we just do n't care about falsy values ? Perhaps accessing arguements is evil/unperformant ? Perhaps this kind of switch case fallthrough has a bad part I did n't think about ? Are these cons enough to avoid using switch ( arguments.length ) as a staple default argument pattern or is it a neat trick I should keep and use in my code ?"
"I have a fairly good sized javascript ( with react/redux but no jquery ) codebase for a webapp I 'm building , and I 've noticed that when I repeatedly open and close a certain panel within the UI , the number of listeners according to Chrome 's performance timeline keeps increasing.The graph looks like this : I have allowed the chrome 's performance monitor run for a good minute or two with the page sitting idle ( just after opening/closing the panel a bunch ) , hoping that perhaps the listeners will get garbage collected , but they are not . I 've switched to other tabs during this process , also hoping that the listeners will get garbage collected when the tab is backgrounded , but they unfortunately are not.I therefore suspect that some listeners are getting registered that are never unregistered.This leads me to two main questions : Does my hypothesis that listeners are getting added and neverunbound seems sensible , or is there more I could be doing to confirmthis suspicion ? Assuming my suspicion is correct , how can I best goabout tracking down the code where the event listener ( s ) is/arebeing added ? I have already tried the following : Looked at the code that is responsible for opening the panel in question , seeing where it adds any listeners , and commenting out those portions to see if there 's any change in the performance graph . There is not a change.Overridden the addEventListener prototype like so : Even after doing this , then commenting out all code portions that cause this console.trace to be executed ( see # 1 ) such that the console.trace is no longer printed upon open/close of the panel , I notice the same increase in listeners in the performance graph . Something else is causing the listeners to increase . I understand that there are other ways that listeners can be added , but it 's not clear to me how to intercept all of those possibilities or cause them to be logged in Chrome 's debugger in such a way that I can tell which code is responsible for adding them.Edit : - At the suggestion of cowbert in the comments , I took a look at this page : https : //developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/eventsI then made the following function : I execute this function after having opened/closed the panel a bunch of times , but unfortunately the `` numListeners '' figure does n't change.If the numListeners figure changed , I would be able to diff the results before/after having open/closed the panel to discover which elementhas the extra event listener registered to it , but unfortunately numListeners does not change.There is also a monitorEvents ( ) API described on https : //developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/events , but the functioncall requires that you specify a DOM element that you wish to monitor . In this situation , I 'm not sure which DOM element has the extralisteners , so I 'm not sure how the monitorEvents ( ) call will really help me . I could attach it to all DOM elements , similar to how I'vewritten the printListenerCount function above , but I presume I 'd run into a similar problem that I ran into with printListenerCount ( ) -- for whatever reason , it 's not accounting for the listener ( s ) in question.Other notes : This is a somewhat complicated reactjs ( preact , technically ) based application . Like most reactjs based apps , components get mounted/unmounted ( inserted into and removed from the DOM ) on the fly . I 'm finding that this makes tracking down `` stray event handler registrations '' like this a bit tricky . So what I 'm really hoping for is some general debugging advice about how to track down `` Stray event handlers '' in large/complex projects such as this . As a C programmer , I would open gdb and set a breakpoint on everything that can possibly cause the `` listeners '' number in the performance graph to increase . I 'm not sure if there 's an analog of that in the javascript world , and even if it there , I 'm just not sure how to do it . Any advice would be much appreciated !"

It seems to me that doing the regular prototypical inheritance is less intrusive and makes more sense for modular applications that do n't need any special treatment to work.Am I missing anything ? Is there any benefit of trying to make Object.create with making constructors ? Or is this only useful for copying existing objects ? I only want access to properties & functions attached to the prototype , and not functions and properties added afterward to the object.Or what about this ( or use a better deep-copy , but the idea remains the same ) ?"

"My understanding is that when I use call method and provide a thisArg the this value in the function is set to object I pass in.And the bind method on the other hand returns a new function with the context of this of the new function set to the object I pass in.But what I do n't understand is why use bind instead of a call .

"I came across the following table which states the internal [ [ Class ] ] property of an object and its corresponding value that the typeof operator returns.One thing to note here is the typeof correctly returns the primitive data types associated in Javascript.However , it returns an object type for an array which inherits from the Array.prototype , but returns a function type for a function that is inheriting from the Function.prototype.Given everything is an object in Javascript ( including arrays , functions & primitive data type objects ) , I find this behaviour of the typeof operator very inconsistent.Can someone throw some light on how the typeof operator works in reality ?"

"I 've been Googling quite some time for e.g . 'typeof ' and 'performance ' , but I have n't been able to find a satisfactory answer to the following problem.I am trying to implement complex numbers for the Transcrypt Python to JavaScript compiler , using local operator overloading . Since we 're dealing with a dynamically typed language , it can not be predicted what type of data will be in a variable.If I translate x + y to JavaScript , having operator overloading switched on , it will translate e.g . as __add__ ( x , y ) In order to do the right thing , the __add__ function has to check for both x and y whether they are 'ordinary ' JavaScript numbers or if one of them or both of them are of type 'complex ' , since that requires special operations.The most obvious way to do that is to test for typeof x == 'number ' . However , coming from a C/C++ background , it seems ridiculously inefficient to test for equality with a string with six characters which on top of that first has to be retrieved from memory , only to possible add two integers , which for many processors , once parsed , would be only one instruction.What amazes me most is that checks like this are advised everywhere around the internet as the normal thing to do . Does anyone know if x == 'number ' or possible x === 'number ' is somehow cleverly optimized to prevent a full string comparison.To further clarify the problem , here 's my current code for the __add__ operator , using the string comparison.If not can anyone hint me on a quicker way to distinguish between a number and an arbitrary non-numerical object.Thanks for the tips .

"So let 's say that I have a reducer which has several branches , but each branch is similar enough to generate with a factory function . So , I create one : Which I use to compose a larger root-level state tree : That should give me a state graph which would look like this : If I wanted to test this state , my first instinct is to create a version of this scope in my test suite , and then test that isolated reducer ( just asserting against the contents , and meta branches ) .The complication here is that I 'm trying to also test selectors , and all of the selector designs I 've read seem to suggest these two things : You encapsulate your state by colocating selectors and reducers in the same file.mapStateToProps should only need to know two things , the global state and a relevant selector.So here 's my problem : Pairing together these more or less composed reducers with root-level-concerned selectors has made my tests a little thick with boilerplate.Not to mention that hard-writing selectors with knowledge of the entire tree feels like it defies the point of the reducer modularity attempt.I 'm 100 % sure I 'm missing something obvious , but I ca n't really find any example code which demonstrates a way to test modular reducers and selectors.If a selector generally should know the entire global state , but you have reducers which are highly composed , is there a clean , idiomatic approach to testing that ? Or maybe a more composable selector design ?"
"I am fairly new to developing chrome extensions , more specifically to the user authentication part in chrome extensions . I am following User Identity example from Google Developer docs .

"Let me clarify my question . I 'm not asking how to make the following code work . I am aware that you can use the let keyword or an iffe that captures its own value of i. I just need clarification on how the value i is accessed in the following code . I read the following blog post about how it is that the following code does not work . Blog postThe writer claims that the code will not work , because we are passing the variable i as a reference instead of a value . That is , instead of providing the value of i per iteration we provide the variable to the callback in setTimeout as a reference which . In effect , when the loop terminates and callbacks fire , we will have reference to the variable i which will be 6 . Is this how it works ? Here is my understanding . My understanding is that we are not `` passing '' anything to the callbacks of the setTimeout function , when the loop is executed . We are merely setting up the asynchronous calls . When the closure callback functions do execute , they then look for the variable i based on lexical scoping rules . That is , the closures look in the scope were the callbacks have closure over , which again , in this case would be 6 since it is done after the for loop completes.Which one is it , does the function resolve the value of i to 6 based on the variable being passed as a reference on each iteration or because of lexical scoping ?"

"What is the best way to populate a javascript typed array with literal data ? Recently I 've been working a lot with javascript typed arrays for some mathematical work . In particular , I 'm using lots of Float32Array objects.I often have to manually populate their values . With a regular array , there is the following literal syntax available : var a = [ 0,1,2 ] ; But there seems to be no equivalent way to populate a typed array , so I find I have to do it with lots of individual statements ; This gets very annoying if there 's more than about 4 values . And it seems wasteful too , both in terms of script size , and javascript execution , because it has to interpret all those individual statements.Another approach I 've used is creating a setter function : But this seems quite wasteful too . I have to create a regular array as big as the typed array first , to feed into the populateArray function , and then there 's the iteration.So ... the question is : Is there a more direct and efficient way to fill a typed array with literal data ?"

"I 'm new to using ui-router and am having some difficulty with a lazy loaded nested ui-view . I 've tried a number of things and though I imagine I 've come close , I ca n't quite get it to work , so whoever fixes the plunker shared below will be awarded the correct answer.Plunker-Firstly , require.js bootstraps the main application , and index.html contains two ui-views , one for the navigation , and one for the main content section . The main content section contains various portfolio items ( Test1 in plnkr ) that are lazy loaded ( with ocLazyLoad ) into the main content section when one is selected.-The main app module defines the various states in its config method , including a state to load the portfolio item according to its ID and based on a naming convention.-When Test1 is clicked , its main module is lazy loaded , and this module defines its own states , and Test1 has its own index.html with its own nested ui-view . Worth noting is that I 've also had to use this module 's run method to run a function that wraps $ state.go in $ timeout , to get template content to appear in the nested ui-view when Test1 is initially clicked . This is hackish and undoubtedly not the right approach and perhaps the source of the issue , as we 'll see shortly . I also tried to put the $ state.go in a service but it did n't make a difference as I ultimately ran into the same problem.-Finally , here 's where things break . If from inside Test1 , you click on Home in the main nav , then try clicking on Test1 again , the template content that appeared previously in the nested ui-view does n't appear ( obviously , since the module 's run function only runs once ) . It 's easy to make it reappear by manually clicking on a link that reloads the state , but obviously this is n't desirable.TL/DR -- Home - > Click on Test1 - > Working ! - > Click Home - > Click Test1 - > Breaks !

"As you most likely already know , it 's simple in JQuery to select all elements in the document that have a specific CSS class , and then , using chaining , assign common event handlers to the selected elements : As usual the class `` toolWindow '' is also normally defined in CSS and associated with some visual styles : The class attribute is now responsible for indicating not just the appearance ( visual state ) of the element , but also the behaviour . As a result , I quite often use this approach and define CSS class names more as pseudo object oriented classes then visual only CSS classes . In other words , each class represents both state ( CSS styles ) and behaviour ( events ) . In some cases I have even created classes with no visual styling and simply use them as a convenient way to assign behaviour to elements . Moreover , the jQuery LiveQuery plugin ( and the live ( ) built-in function ) make this approach even more effective by automatically binding events to dynamically created elements belonging to a specificed class.Of late I am primarily using class names as defining a common set of behaviour for associated DOM elements and only later using them to define a visual style . Questions : Is this a terrible misuse of the CSS `` class '' attribute , if so why ? On the other hand , perhaps it is a perfectly valid approach to further implementing `` separate of concerns '' and improving the maintainability of HTML/DHTML pages ?"

"I have a canvas facebook application which has both a web page and a designated mobile page.The web page works fine and also when simulating the browser to mobile with the console everything works fine.But , when I try to run the app from the facebook mobile app the canvas app loads ( which is correct ) , but it does not login . I am using the FB.login function.and in the settings > advanced - I have the : Client OAuth Login , Web OAuth Login , Embedded Browser OAuth Login , Valid OAuth redirect URIs and Login from Devices filled correctly.but still from the facebook mobile app the canvas app does not preform the login . I have been trying to get this to work all day.and I cant find a solution anywhere.I also cant debug the mobile facebook app.any ideas how to approach this issue ? EDITAlso looked at my Node server logs and I see that the FB.login is not even called . EDIT 2I ended up replacing the login with getLoginStatus which poses no problem to me since its a facebook canvas app ... but the question still remains on how to do the login.EDIT 3 11/26/2015well so getLoginStatus did not completely solve my issue since it does not in fact log the user in so for the canvas games you probably need to login for the first entry if you need permissions ... my solution was to add the login if the getLoginStatus returns not_autorized like so : But wait , there is more ... the FB.login function will not work well on mobile canvas games ( not sure if its just not triggered or the browsers blog the popups or both ) . anyway you need to actively call it via button ... so for mobile canvas games I had to add a start playing button and then the login does work..EDIT 4 ( Final ) eventually I noticed that FB.login ( ) does not get triggered unless its an external event that triggers it , so I had to make a change for Mobile canvas where if the getLoginStatus doesnt return connected then I show a login button which does the login ... the rest stayed the same.what I did for mobile was similar to the accepted answer only to suit my needs ...

"I was trying to understand what I could from jQuery 's animation functions , but ended up running into all sorts of internal functions I did n't understand , and ultimately landed on isWindow . The code for isWindow checks to see if an object has the property setInterval , and returns false otherwise.Of course , any object could have the property setInterval without being the window , and although it would almost have to be a deliberate attempt to sabotage jQuery 's functionality to have an object with that exact property name , I can imagine some reasonable cases where it could be unintentional . Is there not a better way to check if an object is a window object ? Could n't they use something along the lines ofI know the return of toString of an internal function is n't going to be standard across all browsers , but the writers of jQuery seem to have a great understanding of these cross-browser differences . I 'm also aware that this is n't a fool-proof method either , as someone could easily override the toString method to return that same string , but this would still prevent the problem of having an object mistaken for a window .

"The Problem ( Since posting this , I 've gotten a little closer to solving it , but I 'm still stuck . Please check the update at the end of the question ) .I have a site that 's been template using Mustache.js . When the site is run locally , it works fine . The templates are loaded , Mustache replaces the mustache tags with the given data , and the page renders as expected.When the site is run from my ( school ) server however , it develops an odd issue . For whatever reason , Mustache.render is replacing all the mustache tags in my template with nothing ( as in empty strings ) . Obviously , this is causing my site to load very wrong.What I 've Tried To Diagnose ItUsing console logging , I tracked the loaded templates , and what Mustache produces . The results are below : The data to plug into the templates ( siteData.json ) : Body Template ( BodyTemplate.mustache ) : Here 's where it differs . After running the above files through Mustache.render locally , here are the results : Exactly as I 'd expect . All the mustache tags were removed , and replaced with the corresponding data from the JSONHowever , here 's the results when run from my school 's server ( The exact same code ) : Notice how all of the mustache tags were simply removed instead of being replaced by the data.I know everything is being downloaded fine , so it 's not a path issue : While I 've been using mustache for about a week , I have no idea how to diagnose a problem like this . The above snippets were the result of console logging , so I 've verified the input going into Mustache.render , and it all checks out . And again , this only happens when it 's hosted remotely.Here 's my rendering module ( templateLoader.js ) ( The chunk of console logs in the middle of renderPage is the source of the above snippets via the Developer Cosole ) : And here 's the full results of the log : Any guidance at all here would be appreciated.Update : So , while debugging it , I found out the potential source of the problem , but have no idea how to resolve it . When debugging it locally , the data object ( inside renderPage ) is interpreted by Edge as a JS object , and lists each of its attributes . When it 's remote however , the data object is being interpreted as a String ( local is on the left , remote on the right ) : So , the issue seems to be that the data.json is n't being read properly on the server side.I should note that locally , I 'm using Windows , but the school server is `` Apache/2.2.3 ( Red Hat ) '' ( according to Edge 's Network tab ) . I changed the returns from \r\n to \n to adhere to Unix standards , but it did n't change anything.I 've run the JSON file through all of the top JSON validators , and it checks out in all of them , so it does n't seem to be a formatting issue ."

"I have an interesting problem here . I 'm using a class on the element as a switch to drive a fair amount of layout behavior on my site.If the class is applied , certain things happen , and if the class is n't applied , they do n't happen . Javascript is used to apply and remove the class . The relevant CSS is roughly like this : And the HTML : I 've simplified things but this is essentially the method . The whole page changes layout ( hiding the right side in three different areas ) when the flag is set on the body . This works in Firefox and IE8 . It does not work in IE8 in compatibility mode . What is fascinating is that if you sit there and refresh the page , the results can vary . It will pick a different section 's right side to show . Sometimes it will show only the top section 's right side , sometimes it will show the middle.I have tried : - a validator ( to look for malformed html ) - double checked my css formatting , and ... - making sure my IE7 hack sheet was n't having an effect.- putting the flag class on a different , non-body wrapper element ( still has the same odd behavior ) So my question is : - Is there a way that this behavior can be made reliable ? - When does IE7 decide to re-do styling ?

"I 'm really new to HTML and Javascript . I 'd appreciate any help with the code I 'm writing.I 'm working on a calculator to display the distance between airports . The user will have five `` text '' inputs , so they will write airport codes , say MAD , JFK . The result would be the distance between Madrid and JFK . The user can add several airports such as BCN MAD JFK ORD , and the result should be the total addition of all legs ( result = BCN-MAD + MAD-JFK + JFK-ORD ) . For my purpose , it 's also important that the distances are specified by me ( so I dont need to `` calculate '' distances between coordinates ) .What I 've done is I 've created variables called `` leg1,2,3,4 '' which pair each airport , so leg1 can be for example `` BCNMAD '' and then using if statements I can get the distance for that leg . Finally there 's a totalDistance variable to add all the leg distances.Because each leg needs to be calculated separately and added to the other legs , I 've copied the if statements for each separate leg.This seems to work just fine , the problem is so far I 've added just 8 airports . The actual requirement will be approx 200 airports . And because each leg has its own set of if , I could end up with about 800 IFs . I was wondering if there 's any better way to do this ?

Is there a way to reveal all items with scroll reveal with a click event ? Perhaps a reveal all function ? Problem : I am using scroll reveal as well as Isotope . The sorting functionality of isotope reacts strange with scroll reveal.When I click a `` filter '' button I am calling the isotope function filter.However if I scroll down after clicking said filer button there are holes in my grid and I have to `` re-click '' the button after all items have been revealed via scrollingThanks ! ! UpdateI have added the layout call here - this at least fixes holes that were present before : However - the newly filtered items do n't `` fade in '' as they do with scroll reveal they `` tile in '' as with the styling from isotope . The ideal situation would be a reveal all and layout scenario - that way you can not notice any differences in animations - or another situation could be just the simple constant fading in regardless of filters clicked . Update UpdateWe decided to make all the tiles the same height so no longer are experiencing the problem . Thanks

"Question : There seem to be many benefits to Closures , but what are the negatives ( memory leakage ? obfuscation problems ? bandwidth increasage ? ) ? Additionally , is my understanding of Closures correct ? Finally , once closures are created , can they be destroyed ? I 've been reading a little bit about Javascript Closures . I hope someone a little more knowledgeable will guide my assertions , correcting me where wrong.Benefits of Closures : Encapsulate the variables to a local scope , by using an internal function . The anonymity of the function is insignificant.What I 've found helpful is to do some basic testing , regarding local/global scope : Interesting things I took out of it : The alerts in outerFunc are only called once , which is when the outerFunc call is assigned to myFunc ( myFunc = outerFunc ( ) ) . This assignment seems to keep the outerFunc open , in what I would like to call a persistent state.Everytime myFunc is called , the return is executed . In this case , the return is the internal function.Something really interesting is the localization that occurs when defining local variables . Notice the difference in the first alert between global_num1 and global_num2 , even before the variable is trying to be created , global_num1 is considered undefined because the 'var ' was used to signify a local variable to that function . -- This has been talked about before , in the order of operation for the Javascript engine , it 's just nice to see this put to work.Globals can still be used , but local variables will override them . Notice before the third myFunc call , a global variable called local_count is created , but it as no effect on the internal function , which has a variable that goes by the same name . Conversely , each function call has the ability to modify global variables , as noticed by global_var3.Post Thoughts : Even though the code is straightforward , it is cluttered by alerts for you guys , so you can plug and play.I know there are other examples of closures , many of which use anonymous functions in combination with looping structures , but I think this is good for a 101-starter course to see the effects.The one thing I 'm concerned with is the negative impact closures will have on memory . Because it keeps the function environment open , it is also keeping those variables stored in memory , which may/may not have performance implications , especially regarding DOM traversals and garbage collection . I 'm also not sure what kind of role this will play in terms of memory leakage and I 'm not sure if the closure can be removed from memory by a simple `` delete myFunc ; . `` Hope this helps someone , vol7ron"

In other words , crypto.randomBytes without callback will not block even if all entropy sources are drained.In the following example , how would I handle an exception properly and still completely fill the array , basically ensuring the array has been filled completely with the generated bytes . Would I just catch the exception and generate a new array within the catch block , but would if that also throws an exception ? Essentially how would I make this code work properly 100 % of the time ?"

My scenario - I would like to open an upload dialog from my own button and get the uploaded file info . In Uploadcare JS version 0.12 I did the following : In 0.16 there 's no more uploadDone and all it does is return a promise without any data . What should I do ?
"I 'm working on a site that has a page that can potentially become very long . It can have in theory 1000+ rows of data in it . Then these rows could each have sub-rows.I 'm currently using a list / sublist structure to represent the data because it 's difficult to visualize subsets in tables . the subset data is in a table though.The Problem is this : In IE . my hovering over the row styles , tooltips and other javascripts are taking upwards of 5 seconds to fire ! The page hangs like crazy and is pretty much unuseable . In FF , Chrome , and Safari it works just fine.I do n't need a whole bunch of stats saying IE is slow . i know it is . what i need is some suggestions / theories/ ideas on how to combat the slowness ! Some of the ideas i 've had so far : -some kind of paging mechanism . But that gets tricky b/c 1 . It 's a list not a table , and 2. it 's got sub sub lists and sub tables for those sub lists . so we 'd need to somehow page based on the top level i think . because we do n't want to split the data up at all . I guess that might be feasible ... -some kind of mechanism that holds the content in a javascript array or object or soomething and does n't add it to the dom until it 's been scrolled to . and takes it away when you scroll past it . in theory this would be cool . but i think it would be horrible to impliment.-something else entirely ? Thanks in Advance for any ideas ! I 'm probably going to try and put a bounty on this as soon as i 'm able to help inspire you ; ) EDIT : OH MY ! I think i may have found part of the problem using dyna trace ! thanks Pointy for reminding me about this tool . i had forgotten about out . the click event of one of my buttons seems to be firing an insane amount . like 2000 times and count . something is clicking it automatically or something crazy like that . weird thing is , i do n't have any javascripts that trigger that button click ! EDIT : This does n't seem to be an issue anymore.EDIT : Also : i do n't think it is the complexity of my markup that is affecting the responsiveness of my scripts ( i know if i could use just id selectors it would be best , but i 've optimized my selectors and qtips as much as possible ( with help from s.o . in the past ) . i have a button that is just on the page , not nested in anything , that the click handler takes 4 or 5 seconds to register . It 's not that the click action takes a long time , it 's just slow to notice that it 's been clicked.EDIT : i had 5 spans that were each nested in a span unnecessarily , i un-nested those and it seems to have cut the slowness in about 1/2 ! ! ( these 5 spans were repeated in every row ) EDIT : Here 's some of the relevant scripts : The Main Button Handler : The Get ... FIlter functions are very simple functions that run in a few milliseconds ... nothing interesting or noteworthy happening in there.this bit attaches some of the behaviour that is very slow : in other pages they react nice and quick , on this page ... 2-3 seconds.There are 2 different versions of this for 2 different classes , one gets a single `` shift '' one gets the user s for a bunch of shifts . as with other things . once the function itself runs quick , the ajax is fast , the v2ReLoadScheduledActivitySection runs in about 50 ms. nothing interesting in there . : Here 's a bit of the HTML . this is the for a day ... the main list has one of these for every day of the year ( or whatever range they pick ) . There could be any number of sub li 's in that list , but it tends to be between 1-10.anything with TipMe , or GlossaryMe brings up a qtip tooltip.like this : Something tells me it might be all my tooltip handlers that are causing the problem ... Let me know if you guys want anything else !"

"I 'd like to implement a higher order react component which can be used to easily track events ( like a click ) on any React component . The purpose of this is to easily hook clicks ( and other events ) into our first party analytics tracker.The challenge I 've come across is that the React synthetic event system requires events ( like onClick ) be bound to react DOM elements , like a div . If the component I 'm wrapping is a custom component , like every HOC implemented via a higher order function is , my click events do n't bind correctly.For example , using this HOC , the onClick handler will fire for button1 , but not for button2.CodeSandbox with working example : https : //codesandbox.io/embed/pp8r8oj717My goal is to be able to use an HOF like this ( optionally as a decorator ) to track clicks on any React component definition.The only solution I can think of atm is using a Ref on each child and manually binding my click event once the Ref is populated.Any ideas or other solutions are appreciated !

"GoalI 'm trying to create a series of promise 'enhancers ' which will add functionality ( such as caching , queuing , redirect handling , etc . ) around existing promises which are simple http requests.ProblemThe issue I 'm experiencing with this method of enhancing promises is that if an enhancement adds any functions or publicly accessible properties to the promise ( or if I 'm wrapping an already-enhanced promise like a restangular request ) , those are lost when I wrap it in a new promise by returning a new $ q.QuestionWhat pattern can I use to enhance or wrap promises ( like in the two examples below ) , but without losing any other ( non-conflicting ) enhancements promises might have ? Example 1Here is an example that will automatically handle 503-Retry-After errors : The idea is that if I return a promise enhanced with the above function , the user can go : Or to be more clear ( with chaining ) : Here , the first call to then ( ... ) might error out right away if the server is busy , but the calls after .withAutoRetry ( ) will poll the server with repeated requests until the response is successful , or a non RetryAfter error is returned.Example 2Here is an another example which adds custom caching behaviour : This one allows the library to set up a cache of data which can be used instead of making requests to the server , and can be added to after a request is completed . For example : ElsewhereAnd somewhere else entirelyPossible SolutionI 've considered copying the original promise , but then overwriting the new one 's then function with an implementation that references the original promise 's then ( using the Proxy Pattern ) , but is this safe ?

"Is it possible to build navigation for a header component when all of my routes are stores in route module files using lazy loading ? I have seen articles that build navigation dynamically when all of the navigation is stored in a JSON object or file and they load it all in one shot and build it from there , but none of those articles used lazy loading . I have an Angular 6 app that uses lazy loading and has quite an extensive navigation structure , and I do n't want to hard-code all of the navigation items in the HTML , even though that is not hard to do . I think it is a more viable option to load the values from a structure and dynamically build the navigation markup with Angulars *ngFor directive . My question is , is this possible with lazy loading ?

"I 'm making a profile picture crop editor which allows for dragging , scaling and rotating an image within an area.The dragging of the image is done by capturing the mousedown and mousemove event of the area and calculating the cursors starting and stopping x/y coordinates inside the area to get the distance which the cursor has traveled .

"Firefox Quantum finally released on November 14 , 2017 . Quoting from this link : In the past , you could develop Firefox extensions using one of three different systems : XUL/XPCOM overlays , bootstrapped extensions , or the Add-on SDK . By the end of November 2017 , WebExtensions APIs will be the only way to develop Firefox extensions , and the other systems will be deprecated.Using Firefox 57 Quantum and Web Extensions APIs , I want to make an extension that is capable of running on multiple screens . This extension would be used to show multiple screens dashboards.The idea of it was so simple . If two or more screens are detected , every Firefox starting up then opens a new window for every monitor in full screen mode . I can do full screen , but facing issues to open on another monitor and detect how many monitors are attached . Using browser.windows API to create another new tab , here 's some snippet code : Obviously , my solution above is hard-coded for two monitors and sets left parameter to 1366 px , hence this solution will not work properly if the screen resolution not equal to 1366x768 or if there are more than two monitors attached.Thus , is there any API or better approach to detect how many monitors are attached and also check their resolution ? Does Web Extension APIs have a feature for detecting multiple monitors and resolution values ? If not , what are possible workarounds ?"

"I 'm developing a text based adventure game with Meteor and I 'm running into an issue with how to handle certain elements . Namely , how to emit data from the Server to the Client without any input from the Client.The idea is that when a player is engaged in combat with a monster , the combat damage and updating the Player and Monster objects will be occurring in a loop on the server . When the player takes damage it should accordingly update the client UI . Is something like this possible with Publish / Subscribe ? I basically want something that sits and listens for events from the server to update the combat log accordingly.In pseudo-code , this is something along the lines of what I 'm looking for : I understand that you can publish a collection to the client , but that 's not really as specific of a function I 'm looking for , I do n't want to publish the entire Player object to the client , I just want to tell the client to write a line to a textbox saying something like `` You were hit for 12 damage by a monster ! `` .I was hoping there was a function similar to SocketIO where I could , if I wanted to , just emit an event to the client telling it to update the UI . I think I can use SocketIO for this if I need to , but people seemed to be adamant that something like this was doable with Meteor entirely without SocketIO , I just do n't really understand how.The only outs I see to this scenario are : writing all of the game logic client-side which feels like a bad idea , writing all of the combat logs to a collection which seems extremely excessive ( but maybe it 's not ? ) , or using some sort of SocketIO type-tool to just emit messages to the client to tell it to write a new line to the text box ."

"This is a bit of a question with some level of detail to it , so let me first explain the situation , then my implementation and last the question so you understand best . As of April 4 an update is added and the issues are narrowed down to one pending issue , see the bottom of this question for the up to date info.TLDR ; I have a long route returned from Google Maps Directions API and want an Elevation chart for that route . Too bad it does n't work because it 's requested via GET and the URL maximum length is 2.048 chars which get exceeded . I splitted the requests ; guaranteed the correct processing order using Promises ; but Evelation data is n't always complete for full route , is n't always displayed in the correct order , does n't always follow the given path and inter elevation location spans over several km 's sometimes . Introduction ; Trying to create an elevation chart for a Google Maps DirectionsService response I 'm facing an issue with too long routes ( this does n't seem to be related to distance , rather than number of LatLngs per overview_path ) . This is caused by the fact the ElevationService is requested via GET and a maximum length of an URL is 2048 chars . This problem is described on SO here as well.Implementation ; I figured I would be smarter than Google ( not really , but at least trying to find a way to work around it ) , to split the path returned by the DirectionsService ( overview_path property ) into batches and concatenate the results ( elevations returned by the ElevationService method getElevationsAlongPath ) . To get the best level of detail I query the ElevationService with 512samples per batch ; and because the ElevationService spreads the samples over the lengthof the path I set up a maximum number of LatLng per batch and checkhow many batches are required to process the full path ( totalBatches= overview_path.length / maxBatchSize ) ; and finally get an even spread for my directions result in an attemptto get an equal level of detail for the complete route ( batchSize =Math.ceil ( overview_path.length / totalBatches ) ) .While the ElevationService work asynchronously I make sure the requests are all processed in the correct order with help of other SO-users first using setTimout and now working with Promises.My codeSide note ; I 'm also batching the DirectionService 's request to address the 8 waypoint limitation the service has but I can confirm this is not the issue since I 'm also facing the issue with 8 or fewer waypoints.Problem ; The problems I 'm facing are : Elevation data is not always following the full path of route , meaning the last elevation point in the chart is ( far ) from the end of the route ; Elevation data sometimes gets displayed in random order as if it seems the promises were still not waiting for the next task to execute ; Elevation data doens n't always follow the given LatLng 's from theoverview_path provided in a given batch ( see screenshot ) ; Inter elevation distance data is a lot . Sometimes spans multiple km 's while requesting for 512 samples for an evenly matched batch size with a maximum of 200 LatLngs per batch . I figured batching the ElevationService using Promises ( and before timing with setTimtout ) would solve all my problems but the only problem I solved is not exceeding the 2.048 char request URL and facing the above described new issues.Help is really appreciatedAlso I would like to put a 250 rep. bounty on this question right ahead but that 's impossible at this moment . So please feel free to reply as I can later add the bounty and award it to the answer that solves the issues described . A 250 rep. bounty has been awarded to show my appreciation for you to point me in the right direction.Thanks for reading and replying ! Updated at April 4 leaving 1 pending issue ( for as far as I can tell at the moment ) Problem with elevations in random order tackled downI 've been able to tackle some of the problems when I was noticing inconsistent behavior in the directions results . This was caused for an obvious reason : the asynchronous calls were n't `` Promised '' to be scheduled so some of the times the order was correct , most of the times it was n't . I did n't noticed this at first because the markers were displayed correctly ( cached ) .Problem with inter elevation distance tackled downThe div displaying the elevation data was only a 300px wide and containing many datapoints . By such a small width I was simply unable to hover over enough points causing to trigger elevation points which lie further apart from each other . Problem with elevation data not showing along the routeSomehow somewhere down the line I 've also solved this issue but I 'm not sure if the bigger width or `` Promising '' the directions order has solved this.Pending issue : elevation data is not always completeThe only remaining issue is that elevation data is not always covering the full path . I believe this is because an error in the Promising logic because logging some messages in the console tells me the elevation chart is drawn at a point where not all Promise-then 's have completed and I think this is caused by refiring a batched call when an Over Query Limit error is returned by the Google Maps API.How can I refire the same chain when an Over Query Limit error is returned ? I 've tried not to resolve the same function again , but just fire the setTimeout ( ... ) , but then the Promise does n't seem to resolve the refired batch at the moment it is no longer getting an Over Query Limit . Currently this is how I 've set it up ( for both directions and elevation ) :"

Meaning I could I save Waffle ( ) as a variable and do something likeI wish I could use this.name but that does n't work either until it is invoked.I have a feeling I ca n't but wanted to at least ask some of the people here on stack overflow if it was a possibilityAgain your comments and feedback is appreciated

"Apparently , as I 've discovered while commenting on another answer , jQuery ( rather its underlying selector engine Sizzle ) lets you quote the argument to the : not ( ) selector as well as the : has ( ) selector . To wit : In the Selectors standard , quotes are always representative of a string and never of a selector or a keyword , so quoting the argument to : not ( ) is always invalid . This will not change in Selectors 4.You can also see that it 's non-standard syntax by adding an unsupported CSS selector such as : nth-last-child ( 1 ) causing the selector to fail completely : Is there any good reason , technical or otherwise , for allowing quotes here ? The only possibilities that come to mind are : Consistency with : contains ( ) which allows both quoted and unquoted arguments , as seen in the old Selectors spec .

"I 'm experimenting with web workers , and was wondering how well they would deal with embarassingly parallell problems . I therefore implemented Connaway 's Game of Life . ( To have a bit more fun than doing a blur , or something . The problems would be the same in that case however . ) At the moment I have one web worker performing iterations and posting back new ImageData for the UI thread to place in my canvas . Works nicely.My experiment does n't end there however , cause I have several CPU 's available and would like to parallellize my application . So , to start off simply I split my data in two , down the middle , and make two workers each dealing with a half each . The problem is of course the split . Worker A needs one column of pixels from worker B and vice versa . Now , I can clearly fix this by letting my UI-thread give that column down to the workers , but it would be much better if my threads could pass them to eachother directly . When splitting further , each worker would only have to keep track of it 's neighbouring workers , and the UI thread would only be responsible for updating the UI ( as it should be ) .My problem is , I do n't see how I can achieve this worker-to-worker communication . I tried handing the neighbours to eachother by way of an initialization postMessage , but that would copy my worker rather than hand down a reference , which luckily chrome warned me about being impossible.Finally I see that there 's something called a SharedWorker . Is this what I should look into , or is there a way to use the Worker that would solve my problem ?"

Encapsulate the code that requires the values that are modified over time in a monad , call it Signal , then use those signals like so ( using Haskell do-notation for simplicity ) .Or is there more to FRP than I 'm understanding ? Are there paradigms that prevent using such a simple representation using monads ? Or is this a valid ( if perhaps simplified ) understanding of how FRP works ?"

"I am implementing sound effects in HTML5 audio but after a while , it just stops playing any audio . The file type is correct because it starts fine but then seems to give up.Is there a better way to do this so it consistently plays sound ? Here is a link to my implementation . Easy to reproduce by pressing spacebar a lot until it eventually gives up ( also shoot the lights for added sounds ) . http : //craftyjs.com/elevatoraction/This occurs for me in the latest version of Chrome ( 8.0 ) Edit : I did as Gaurav suggested and only played the same instance of each sound file , but the same sort of problems are present . It will arbitrarily stop playing.Edit 2 : I just noticed that whenever I try to play the sound , the networkState is always 1 which according to this means it has n't fully loaded . That is odd seeing as it still plays sometimes and even when it plays the networkState is always 1"
"I am using select2 in an express app to make an input box where users can select subjects from a list , and can update this list with any newly added options.The thing I 'm struggling with is that select2 runs client-side , whereas any data I use to seed my < option > tags ( that I want to append new options to ) is server-side.I want users to be able to add subjects that do n't exist in the original list , so that future users will be presented with newly added options ( as well as the original ones ) These are the options I 've considered for achieving this ( in increasing desirability ) : Add new < option > Subject < /option > html tags for each added tagPush new tags to an array , and seed the < option > s from this arraySeed the < option > from a json object , and update this object on tag creationSeed the < option > from an external database ( e.g . mongoose ) , and update this on tag creationAs far as I can see , all of these options require that my client-side code ( select2-js ) talks to server-side code ( where my array , .json file or mongoose schema would be ) , and I have no idea how to go about doing this . In my current approach I am attempting to to specify a `` local '' json file as my data source in my select2 call ( see here ) . However , this does n't seed the database with any options , so this is n't working as I expected . I then check if each new tag exists in an array ( dataBase ) , and add it to the database if not : However , this approach will add the new tags to an array that is destroyed once I refresh the page , and new tags are not stored.How can I modify this to load server-side data ( json , mongoose document or anything else that is considered a best practice ) , and update this data with newly added options ( that pass my tests ) ?"

"I know a little bit of BaconJS , but now I 'm trying to learn RxJS by creating a `` User is typing ... '' indicator .

If it 's a 1 , then I show the indicator . If it 's a 0 , then I hide the indicator.This is what that looks like : Here is a link to the JSBin : http : //jsbin.com/vekixuv/edit ? js , console , outputThere are several problems and questions I have with this implementation : Sometimes when the user is typing , a 0 sneaks through , so the indicator flashes away for a split second before coming back on the next user keystroke.It 's not guaranteed that the indicator will disappear 1 second after the user stops typing . It 's only guaranteed that the indicator will disappear within 1 second ( which is kind of the opposite of what we want ) .Is using a heartbeat stream the correct RxJS way to do this ?

"I run into an issue recently - in some parts of my angular application I have to show the date in the following format : MMMM yyyy , as well in some components of the Angular UI Bootstrap framework.The basic issue is that in some languages the month in nominative and genitive case is spelled differently . In my case that would be Polish , Ukrainian and Russian.As it seems by default MMMM stands for month name in genitive case , which generally makes sense.Though I 've noticed that in angular locale files for Russian and Polish language there is a property STANDALONEMONTH which , as I see , stands for month name in nominative . ( though file for Ukrainian is missing that part ) Though I 'm not quite sure how to take use on those.My basic suggestion would be to go with a decorator for the dateFilter.So the question is - whether there is a standard way for month name inflection handling in angular , or a workaround that is commonly used , so that the third party libraries using the $ locale would use the proper month name.ExampleAs you see - for Ukrainian and Polish the name of the month should have a different ending in those two cases . As well for Polish and Russian there is a month name in proper case in angular locale files ( STANDALONEMONTH ) .

Do this with the web inspector open and recording on the Timeline tab . Highlight the region of the timeline that correlates to when you 've fired the change event ( fire the change event multiple times ) and you 'll see the event listeners ( in the window below ) increase by 100 on each change event . If managed & removed properly , each event listener would be properly removed before rendering a new input , but I have not found a way to properly do that with inline javascript events.What that code does is this : onChange , the input element triggers a validation functionThat function validates the input and colors the border if successfulThen after 1 second ( to demonstrate the memory leak ) the input element is replaced with identical HTML 100 times in a row without unbinding the change event ( because I do n't know how to do that.. that 's the problem here ) . This simulates changing the view within a single-page app . This creates 100 new eventListeners in the DOM , which is visible through the web inspector.Interesting Note . $ ( 'input ' ) .removeAttr ( 'onchange ' ) ; will actually prevent the onchange event from being fired in the future , but does not garbage collect the eventListener/DOM stuff that is visible in the web inspector.This screenshot is after change event fires 3 times . Each time , 100 new DOM nodes are rendered with identical HTML and I 've attempted to unbind the onchange event from each node before replacing the HTML.Update : I came back to this question and just did a quick little test using the JSFiddle to make sure that the answer was valid . I ran the 'test ' dozens of times and then waited -- sure enough , the GC came through and took care of business ."
"I 'm attempting to develop a serverless JavaScript web application consisting of API Gateway ( w/ an Amazon Cognito Custom Authorizer ) , Lambda , and DynamoDB . This post is my last attempt to make Cognito work for my needs before completely giving up on it ( for a 2nd time ) . I 'll try to infuse a bit what I 've learned since the Cognito documentation is confusing and lacking.With Cognito , you can develop a custom authentication workflow with your own registration , sign in , etc . web pages . You also have the option to leverage Amazon 's Hosted Web UI to make things a bit simpler ( although with very few HTML/CSS customization options ) . I 'm using the latter . When configuring an App Client for a Cognito User Pool , the most critical decision you have to make is whether to use an Authorization Code Grant or an Implicit Grant . With an Authorization Code Grant , a successful authentication will return a session token containing a JWT id_token , access_token , and refresh_token to your caller . With an Implicit Grant , your caller will receive an Authorization code that can be used to obtain an id_token and an access_token only , with no refresh_token . The Implicit Grant is most suitable for serverless ( or single-page ) applications because it wo n't expose a long-lived refresh_token to the client which can be easily compromised and used to assume valid access to your application . However , the access_token has a fixed expiration of one hour that can not be configured at this time . So , without a refresh token to silently renew the access_token , your user will have to log-in every hour.Since my web application in no way contains sensitive information , I 'm going to use the Authorization Code Grant and persist the tokens in the browser 's LocalStorage ( which is unsafe , not recommended , and a bad practice ) in hopes that , at some point , Cognito will fully comply with the OpenId Spec and provide full support for refresh tokens with implicit grants via prompt=none . As you can see , Amazon has been unresponsive on the matter . Heck , even an option to customize the expiration time of the access_token ( with Implicit grant ) would be a nice compromise.So I 've successfully deployed the sample application from the amazon-cognito-auth-js JavaScript library , which is meant to be used with the Hosted Web UI flow . This should not be confused with the amazon-cognito-identity-js library , which should be used if you 're developing your own custom authentication workflow . The amazon-cognito-auth-js library supports both the Authorization Code Grant as well as the Implicit Grant and will handle parsing the tokens , caching/retrieving them to/from LocalStorage , and silently renewing the access_token with the refresh token ( for Authorization Code Grant ) .When I sign-in , my browser URL resembles the following : https : //www.myapp.com/home ? code=ABC123XYZ ... and the three JWT tokens are set in the browser 's LocalStorage . If I immediately refresh the page , however , I receive an `` invalid_grant '' error , because the Authorization code is still in the URL and has already been consumed . Should I just do a page redirect upon successful sign-in to remove the Authorization code from the URL ? Here 's the main code at play which I plan to call fromthe onLoad ( ) of every page in my app :"

"I am writing a function that can create an email template from a HTML template and some information that is given . For this I am using the $ compile function of Angular . There is only one problem I can not seem to solve . The template consists of a base template with an unlimited amount of ng-include 's . When I use the 'best practice ' $ timeout ( advised here ) It works when I remove all the ng-include 's . So that is not what I want . The $ timeout example : When I start to add ng-include 's to the template this function starts to return templates that are not yet fully compiled ( a workarround is nesting $ timeout functions ) . I believe this is because of the async nature of a ng-include . Working codeThis code returns the html template when it is done rendering ( function can now be reused , see this question for the problem ) . But this solution is a big no go since it is using the angular private $ $ phase to check if there are any ongoing $ digest 's . So I am wondering if there is any other solution ? What I wantI would like to have a functionality that could handle an unlimited amount of ng-inlude 's and only return when the template has succesfully been created . I am NOT rendering this template and need to return the fully compiled template . SolutionAfter experimenting with @ estus answer I finally found an other way of checking when $ compile is done . This resulted in the code below . The reason I am using $ q.defer ( ) is due to the fact that the template is resolved in an event . Due to this I can not return the result like a normal promise ( I can not do return scope. $ on ( ) ) . The only problem in this code is that it depends heavily on ng-include . If you serve the function a template that does n't have an ng-include the $ q.defer is never resovled ."

"I 'd like to understand under which circumstances variables which are no further used are stored in closures and lead to memory leaks . My most preferred outcome would be `` there are none '' , but this does n't seem to be the case.From what I understand , once a function is declared inside another function , its internal [ [ scope ] ] is assigned the LexicalEnvironment of its encapsulating function . This LexicalEnvironment has reference local variables and the entire scope chain at that point . This basically includes all free variables the function could access ( from what I understood of lostechies , javascript closures explained ) .Here the first issue arises : this should mean all those variables can be reached as long as the function lives . E.g . the following should already leak : This luckily does n't seem to be the case on my firefox . I 've received several explanations to why this does n't leak , from `` the jitter is smart '' to `` LexicalEnvironment is a record type which means GC can collect the unused variables '' . I still do n't know whether either is correct , whether this does n't leak on all modern runtimes and why.After further research , I found auth0 , four types of leaks in javascript ( sadly , there appears to be no html id to jump to , the relevant part is `` 4 : Closures '' ) which shows a way to trick whatever smart thing is collecting the unused variables . In above snippet , when just uncommenting the `` unused '' function , I do not see RAM usage ever going down again ( it was already noted that it could be GC simply did not run for other reasons . However , so far , I am assuming it leaks . I also got told this was limited to firefox , but it appeared to produce similar behavior in chrome ) This example ( in case it really does what i believe it does ) , shows that completely unused variables can leak due to a function declaration in the same scope.To conclude my problems : What is the reason for , in the above snippet , `` big '' getting collected ( when `` unused '' is commented ) and does this happen on all modern runtimes ? Assuming the example with the `` unused '' function not commented leaks , what are best practices to avoid such accidental leaks ? Are there any more ? I already got the suggestion of null'ing all local variables which are not further used at the end of functions , however , this seems absurdly ugly . I fear using temporary variables for pre-calculations and accidentally leaking.PS : It is quite hard to make certain that this question has not already been asked in the jungle of questions about memory leaks with closures ."

"I 'm creating a simple grid based browser game where I would like to place players and target cells ( think king-of-the-hill ) equidistantly . Ideally this would be done in such a way that each player would also be equally distant from the nearest target cell.Here are the requirements : The game needs to support 2 to 20 players.The n by m grid can be any size , but the more 'square-like ' the better . ( The principle behind 'square-like ' is to reduce the maximum required distance to travel across the grid - keep things more accessible ) The number of target cells is flexible . Each player should have equal access to the same number of targets.The minimum distance between any player or target and any other player or target is 4.Note that each cell has 8 immediate neighbors ( yes diagonals count as a distance of 1 ) , and edges wrap . Meaning those at the bottom are logically adjacent to those at the top , and same for left/right.I 've been trying to think of a good algorithm to place players and targets in varying distributions without having to create a specific pre-determined grid for each number of players . I discovered k-means clustering and Lloyd 's Algorithm , but I 'm not very familiar with them , and do n't really know how to apply them to this specific case , particularly since the number of target cells is flexible , which I would think should simplify the solution a bit.Here 's a snippet of vastly simplified code creating a pre-determined 6 player grid , just to show the essence of what I 'm aiming for : It creates a grid that looks like this : Where blue cells are players and red cells are targets.Does anyone have any suggestions for how to go about this ? Links to helpful material would be greatly appreciated.Are there any gurus out there who can drum up an awesome placement algorithm which satisfies all of the above conditions ? It would be AMAZING if the solution also allows the number of target cells and/or minimum distance to be configurable for any number of players and still satisfies all of the conditions , although that 's not strictly necessary.EDITAfter some other game design considerations , I changed the minimum distance between player & target to 4 instead of 2 . The text , code , and image above have been changed accordingly . At the time of this edit , no solutions were constrained by that requirement , so it should n't affect anything.EDIT 2If you are proposing a solution , please provide JavaScript code ( or at least pseudo-code ) outlining the detailed steps of your solution . Also please explain how the solution meets the requirements . Thank you !"
"Using django-leaflet I 've created a form as followsIts instantiated from a view in the normal way . And in the templates ; -Now . At the start on body load , it hides the div containing the map , and elsewhere there is some code that essentially watches the annotationType dropdown , and if `` location '' is selected it unhides the div . The problem is , it appears leafletjs does not like being instantiated hidden , and seems to get a bit confused about its bounds . Im assuming the answer thus is to call _onresize ( ) on the map , however I ca n't seem to find how to get a reference to the map instance ... just produces a complaint that the map is already initialized . Inspecting the code generated by the form seems to have the map being created inside a ( function ( ) { etc etc } ) ( ) type closure which makes just hijacking the variable from there infeasible . So my question is , how DOES one get a reference to a leaflet.js map in this sort of situation ? There is How can I get a leaflet.js instance using only a DOM object ? but it does n't seem to actually answer the question , just propose an alternative that is n't available in my case ."

"I am using reactjs and the flux architecture in a project I 'm working on . I am a bit puzzled by how to break up nested data correctly into stores and why I should split up my data into multiple stores.To explain the problem I 'll use this example : Imagine a Todo application where you have Projects . Each project has tasks and each task can have notes.The application uses a REST api to retrieve the data , returning the following response : The fictive application 's interface displays a list of projects on the left and when you select a project , that project becomes active and its tasks are displayed on the right . When you click a task you can see its notes in a popup.What I would do is use 1 single store , the `` Project Store '' . An action does the request to the server , fetches the data and instructs the store to fill itself with the new data . The store internally saves this tree of entities ( Projects - > Tasks - > Notes ) .To be able to show and hide tasks based on which project is selected I 'd also keep a variable in the store , `` activeProjectId '' . Based on that the view can get the active project , its tasks and render them.Problem solved.However : after searching a bit online to see if this is a good solution I see a lot of people stating that you should use a separate store per entity.This would mean : A ProjectStore , TaskStore and NoteStore . To be able to manage associations I would possibly also need a `` TasksByProjectStore '' and a `` NotesByTaskStore '' .Can someone please explain why this would be better ?

"I saw someone use 0 instead of an empty array for the second argument in useEffect.So instead ofit wasIt seems to have the same effect so I 'm wondering why he used that ? An empty array is considered 0 depending on how you evaluate it . For instance [ ] == 0 is true , but [ ] === 0 is false . So maybe in this case there is n't a strict comparison under the hood and it does not matter if you use 0.Just following the react docs i would use an empty array.React docs : If you want to run an effect and clean it up only once ( on mount andunmount ) , you can pass an empty array ( [ ] ) as a second argument . Thistells React that your effect doesn ’ t depend on any values from propsor state , so it never needs to re-run . This isn ’ t handled as a specialcase — it follows directly from how the dependencies array alwaysworks.I 'm wondering if 0 is a potentially more concise binary argument to use over [ ] , or if using 0 is a bad practice , or if it does n't matter and [ ] is just a preferred React convention ?

"First I would like to appreciate all of you great people for being so helpful to new programmers.I have a question about long polling . I have studied some articles about Long polling technique of Comet Programming . The method seems a lot difficult to me because it also sometimes requires installing some scripts on the server side . Now I have found an example on long polling . Its working great but I am not sure if it is the proper method . The example script is about a chat-like application . This php script works as follows : The php script checks the data.txt file continuously until it is changed.As soon as the data.txt is changed , the new text is outputted on the webpage.Here is the php script : I am not including the webpage code to keep the question simple . The webpage has just a div which shows the text of data.txt whenever it is changed.Main points of my question are : Is this looping method the proper method to long poll the server ? Also when the server is executing sleep ( ) ; what will happen to other simultaneous requests ? Is there any technique to reduce the load on server due to long polling 's continuous script ? If a client starting this long poll request disconnects , how can we know and stop the script for that disconnected client accordingly ? Kindly guide me with this problem ... Thanks"

"I wanted to extend String object prototype with some utility method . It worked , but the performance was surprisingly low . Passing a string to a function is 10x times faster than overriding the String.prototype method that is doing the same thing . To make sure this really happens I created a very simple count ( ) function and the corresponding methods . ( I was experimenting , and created three different versions of the method . ) Results : As you can see the difference is dramatic.The below proves that performance of method calls is neglectably slower , and that the function code it self is slower for methods.Results : Although on huge repetitions ( like 1e8 ) prototyped methods proves to be 10x times slower than functions , this can be ignored for this case.All this may be related only to a String object , because simple generic objects perform about the same when you pass them to functions or call their methods : Results : I 've been searching on Stackoverflow and binging , but other that the recommendation `` do not extend String or Array because you pollute the name space '' ( which is not a problem for my particular project ) , I can not find anything related to performance of methods compared to functions .

"I 'm trying to create a reliable compass in Javascript/JQuery ( using deviceorientation ) so that it works on iOS and Android mobile devices.I know nearly every ( very old ) question/answer here in Stackoverflow about this topic . I have created a pretty simple compass that is working fine on iOS devices . On Android devices ( Galaxy S8 ) I have a weird behaviour : Like every day I 'm testing it the compass direction North switches by an offset to -45/+45 , 90 ( North is in East ) , 180 ( North is in South ) or 270 degrees ( North is in West ) .

"Let 's imagine we have those Django models : When using the admin to manage those models , the band field is associated to a Widget rendered by Django as a select html element.Django 's admin also adds a green plus icon next to the select , clicking it opens a pop-up window where the user is presented with the Form to add a new band . When clicking the save button in this pop-up window , the new band name is saved in the DB , and automatically assigned to the select value.We rely on some javascript to be run each time a select value changes . It is currently listening to the change event of said element , which works fine when the user clicks a value directly in the menu proposed by the select.Sadly , when this select is populated through the Admin Popup functionality , it seems the change event is not fired for the select , as our callback is not executed , even though the element 's value is actually changed.Is there another event we can listen to to get the same behaviour than when the user clicks a value directly from the list ?"

"I 'm trying to add a javascript bookmarklet link to a post on my WordPress site . However it is n't coming out in the post preview . When I check the link that WordPress adds to the post it has converted it to javascript : void ( 0 ) . This simple example reproduces the problem.There are a few other people who 've had the same problem here , here , here , and here but no-one seems to have found a solution beyond just giving their bookmarklet code for people to copy and paste and create their own bookmarklet.The cause of this problem is that Chrome 's XSS protection is stripping out the javascript from the link when submitting it via wp-admin . One `` solution '' is to add the line header ( `` X-XSS-Protection : 0 '' ) ; to wp-blog-header.php in the root folder . This is insecure as it switches off the XSS protection on your WordPress site but it does allow the bookmarklet code to be rendered when the page loads.Are there any real solutions to this problem that do n't involve switching off XSS protection ? Is there a perhaps a plugin I can install to my WordPress to allow me to add javascript : links inside my posts ?"
"I wish I could be more specific here , but unfortunately this might be hard . I basically hope this is some `` well '' -known timeout or setup issue.We have a website running an ( JS/html - ASP.net project ) website overview on a screen at a factory . This screen has no keyboard so it should keep refreshing the page forever - years perhaps ( though 1 week might be okay ) . ( It is used by factory workers to see incoming transports etc . ) This all works perfectly ; the site continuously updates itself and gets the new correct data.Then , sometimes , in the morning this `` overview '' screen has no data and the workers have to manually refresh the site using the simple refresh button or F5 - which fixes everything.I have tried a few things trying to reproduce the error myself including : Cutting the internet connection and MANY other ways of making it timeout ( breakpoints , stopping services etc . ) .Setting the refresh time of setInterval to 100ms and letting the site run 3-5 minutes . ( normal timer is 1 minute ) setInterval SHOULD run forever according to the internet searching I have done.Checked that `` JavaScript frequency '' has not been turned down in power saving settings.No matter what ; the site resumes correct function WITHOUT a refresh as soon as I plug in the internet cable or whatever again - I ca n't reproduce the error.The website is dependent on a backend WCF service and project integration , but since the workers are fixing this with a simple refresh I am assuming this has not crashed.EDIT : The browser I tried to reproduce the error in was IE/win7 . I will ask about the factory tomorrow , but I am guessing IE/win ? also.Is setInterval in fact really infinite or is there something else wrong here ? All help much appreciated.UPDATE : I came in this morning after leaving the website running in debug mode with a breakpoint in the catch clause of the site updating code.There was a 2 min . timeout error ( busy server cleanup during the night likely ) and THEN forever after that a null-reference error at this line : I fixed it with a refresh like the workers.I am now thinking it may be a session timeout all though we keep pinging the server..Of course my particular session timeout may have been caused by the breakpoint making it hang forever at the first timeout - still the behavior is the same as at the factory.I will make sure to update you guys with the final solution later.UPDATE 2 : Testing is ongoing.UPDATE 3 : The factory is IE 9 , their test machine is IE 7 and my machine is IE 9 . The error was seen on IE7 but NOT my IE9 after a weekends runtime.We tried turning off ajax cache during our critical data_binding code , but it did nothing.I tested for memory leaks and was able to create a decent leak IF I refresh 100 times per minute . I do n't think it was the problem though and a refresh cleaned the memory used.We will try the auto-refresh thing now ."

I have limited the size of the thread pool to 25.How can one know that all the threads are exhausted at run time ? Is there any way to find that all the define threads are exhausted during a new request ? I 'm using Native Abstractions for Node.js ( NAN ) to call C++ functions .

The MDN gives the following working example of Symbol.species : The ECMAScript 2015 specifications says : A function valued property that is the constructor function that is used to create derived objects.The way I understand it it would be mainly used to Duck-Type in some way custom objects in order to trick the instanceof operator.It seems very useful but I have not managed to use it on plain objects ( FF 44.0a2 ) : Is there any way to use Symbol.species on plain objects in order to trick the instanceof operator ?
"Background : Let 's say you have a simple page which has a logo and a heading only and one paragraphThis is how that looks likeThat page , obviously would not have vertical overflow / scroll bar for almost even tiny scale mobile devices , let alone computers.QuestionHow can you bring that heading to the top left of the screen and move the logo out of focus unless someone scrolls up ?

"Currently , I have multiple angular modules . A custom Grunt task concats , minifies and packages each module so it is ready to deploy .

For example , in a controller , I declare a variable $ scope.version = ' 1.0.0 ' . But currently , it is hardcoded in the controller script.First question , is there a way the module could get the version from the package.json file ?

"This question is probably more about Webpack and ES6 import than about Vue.I 'm writing a Vuex mutation that adds a new mykey : [ ] to an object in state .

"Original QuestionI have a working version of my web application that I am trying to upgrade at the moment , and I 'm running into the issue of having a task which takes too long to complete in during a single HTTP request . The application takes a JSON list from a JavaScript front end by an HTTP Post operation , and returns a sorted/sliced version of that list . As the input list gets longer , the sorting operation takes a much longer time to perform ( obviously ) , so on suitably long input lists , I hit the 60 second HTTP request timeout , and the application fails.I would like to start using the deferred library to perform the sort task , but I 'm not clear on how to store/retrieve the data after I perform that task . Here is my current code : Ideally I would like to replace the entire try/except block with a call to the deferred task library : But I 'm unclear on how I would get the result back from that operation . I 'm thinking I would have to store it in the Datastore , and then retrieve it , but how would my JavaScript front end know when the operation is complete ?

I hope this is helpful for anyone else attempting to solve a similar problem .

"On node v8.1.4 and v6.11.1I started out with the following echo server implementation , which I will refer to as pipe.js or pipe.And I benchmarked it with wrk and the followinglua script ( shortened for brevity ) that will send a small body as a payload.At 2k requests per second and 44ms of average latency , performance is not great.So I wrote another implementation that uses intermediate buffers until therequest is finished and then writes those buffers out . I will refer to this asbuffer.js or buffer.Performance drastically changed with buffer.js servicing 20k requests persecond at 4ms of average latency.Visually , the graph below depicts the average numberof requests serviced over 5 runs and various latency percentiles ( p50 ismedian ) .So , buffer is an order of magnitude better in all categories . My question is why ? What follows next are my investigation notes , hopefully they are at least educational.Response BehaviorBoth implementations have been crafted so that they will give the same exactresponse as returned by curl -D - -- raw . If given a body of 10 d 's , both willreturn the exact same response ( with modified time , of course ) : Both output 128 bytes ( remember this ) .The Mere Fact of BufferingSemantically , the only difference between the two implementations is thatpipe.js writes data while the request has n't ended . This might make onesuspect that there could be multiple data events in buffer.js . This is nottrue.Empirically : Chunk length will always be 10Buffers length will always be 1Since there will only ever be one chunk , what happens if we remove buffering and implement a poor man 's pipe : Turns out , this has as abysmal performance as pipe.js . I find thisinteresting because the same number of res.write and res.end calls are madewith the same parameters . My best guess so far is that the performancedifferences are due to sending response data after the request data has ended.ProfilingI profiled both application using the simple profiling guide ( -- prof ) .I 've included only the relevant lines : pipe.jsbuffer.jsWe see that in both implementations , C++ dominates time ; however , the functionsthat dominate are swapped . Syscalls account for nearly half the time forpipe , yet only 1 % for buffer ( forgive my rounding ) . Next step , whichsyscalls are the culprit ? Strace Here We ComeInvoking strace like strace -c node pipe.js will give us a summary of the syscalls . Here are the top syscalls : pipe.jsbuffer.jsThe top syscall for pipe ( epoll_wait ) with 44 % of the time is only 0.6 % ofthe time for buffer ( a 140x increase ) . While there is a large timediscrepancy , the number of times epoll_wait is invoked is less lopsided withpipe calling epoll_wait ~8x more often . We can derive a couple bits ofuseful information from that statement , such that pipe calls epoll_waitconstantly and an average , these calls are heavier than the epoll_wait forbuffer.For buffer , the top syscall is writev , which is expected considering mostof the time should be spent writing data to a socket.Logically the next step is to take a look at these epoll_wait statementswith regular strace , which showed buffer always contained epoll_wait with100 events ( representing the hundred connections used with wrk ) and pipehad less than 100 most of the time . Like so : pipe.jsbuffer.jsGraphically : This explains why there are more epoll_wait in pipe , as epoll_waitdoes n't service all the connections in one event loop . The epoll_wait forzero events makes it look like the event loop is idle ! All this does n't explainwhy epoll_wait takes up more time for pipe , as from the man page it statesthat epoll_wait should return immediately : specifying a timeout equal to zero cause epoll_wait ( ) to return immediately , even if no events are available.While the man page says the function returns immediately , can we confirm this ? strace -T to the rescue : Besides supporting that buffer has fewer calls , we can also see that nearlyall calls took less than 100ns . Pipe has a much more interesting distributionshowing that while most calls take under 100ns , a non-negligible amount takelonger and land into the microsecond land.Strace did find another oddity , and that 's with writev . The return value isthe number of bytes written.pipe.jsbuffer.jsRemember when I said that both output 128 bytes ? Well , writev returned 123bytes for pipe and 128 for buffer . The five bytes difference for pipe isreconciled in a subsequent write call for each writev.And if I 'm not mistaken , write syscalls are blocking.ConclusionIf I have to make an educated guess , I would say that piping when the requestis not finished causes write calls . These blocking calls significantly reducethe throughput partially through more frequent epoll_wait statements . Whywrite is called instead of a single writev that is seen in buffer isbeyond me . Can someone explain why everything I saw is happening ? The kicker ? In the official Node.jsguideyou can see how the guide starts with the buffer implementation and then movesto pipe ! If the pipe implementation is in the official guide there should n't besuch a performance hit , right ? Aside : Real world performance implications of this question should be minimal , as the question is quite contrived especially in regards to the functionality and the body side , though this does n't mean this is any less of a useful question . Hypothetically , an answer could look like `` Node.js uses write to allow for better performance under x situations ( where x is a more real world use case ) '' Disclosure : question copied and slightly modified from my blog post in the hopes this is a better avenue for getting this question answeredJuly 31st 2017 EDITMy initial hypothesis that writing the echoed body after the request stream has finished increases performance has been disproved by @ robertklep with his readable.js ( or readable ) implementation : Readable performed at the same level as buffer while writing data before the end event . If anything this makes me more confused because the only difference between readable and my initial poor man 's pipe implementation is the difference between the data and readable event and yet that caused a 10x performance increase .

"I 'm asking this because a couple of times now , I 've tried to play around with the $ locationProvider.html5Mode ( true ) command along with < base href= '' / '' > and ran into a lot of errors calling the scripts/styles/images for my project . I guess there must be something I am doing wrong , but is there a certain folder structure you should follow so you do n't run into these errors ? Or is there a specific way that the base href works that I 'm not quite understanding ? Recently , I thought I 'd try it on a very , very small app . It 's effectively a static website , but I want to take advantage of Angular 's routing to make sure all of the pages can load instantly . So my structure would be something like this : So I know that this folder structure is n't great , but I 'll only be using Angular in this project for routing , nothing more , so it fits my needs.I put into the head < base href= '' / '' > , put in body ng-app and ng-controller , and inside the body put a < div ng-view > somewhere too.I added in the $ locationProvider.html5Mode ( true ) and tried the app out . All of my scripts are then being loaded as http : //localhost:8888/script.js which is incorrect . The project is located in a folder so that index.html is located in http : //localhost:8888/my-project/index.html . So , it should be loading the scripts from http : //localhost:8888/my-project/js/angular/app.js for example.Is there something that I 'm not understanding about the base href ? Eventually I may host this app somewhere online , so I want the URLs to scripts etc to all be relevant to the file really . Anyone have any ideas ? Alright , so above the base href tag I would have my CSS styles which would be linked as css/style.css and at the bottom of my body tag I would have my scripts loaded as js/init.js or js/angular/app.js for example . This would try to load it as if the js folder is located directly at localhost:8888/js ."

This structure is working nicely for me so far , but one issue I 've run into is working out how to handle services that might not always be present.My current solution is pretty simple - I use $ injector.has ( ) to check if the service currently exists , and if so , I use $ injector.get ( ) to grab it : This seems to work - however , I ca n't find much information on the use of this pattern and whether or not it has any potential downsides.So , my questions are : Are there any caveats to using the injector this way that I should be aware of ? Is there a better/more idiomatic way of doing this ?"

"I am working to improve performance of a function that takes an XML string and replaces certain characters ( encoding ) before returning the string . The function gets pounded , so it is important to run as quickly as possible . The USUAL case is that none of the characters are present - so I would like to especially optimize for that . As you will see in the sample code , the strings to be replaced are short , and relatively few . The source strings will often be short ( e.g . 10-20 characters ) but could be longer ( e.g . 200 characters or so ) .So far I have ensured that the regexes are precompiled and I 've eliminated nested functions which slowed down operation ( partial milliseconds matter at this point . ) Is it possible that in this scenarioString.replace functions will be better ?

Whitespace characters are the following : The function will be called a lot of times , so it must be really , really performant . But should n't take too much memory ( like mapping every character to true/false in an array ) . Things I 've tried out so far : regexp - not quite performanttrim and check if length is 0 - not quite performant , also uses additional memory to hold the trimmed stringchecking every string character against a hash set containing whitespace characters ( if ( ! whitespaceCharactersMap [ str [ index ] ] ) ... ) - works well enoughmy current solution uses hardcoded comparisons : This seems to work 50-100 % faster than hash set ( tested on Chrome ) .Does anybody see or know further options ? Update 1I 'll answer some of the comments here : It 's not just checking user input for emptyness . I have to parse certain data format where whitespace must be handled separately.It is worth optimizing . I 've profiled the code before . Checking for blank strings seems to be an issue .

Probably the best choice for Node.js from performance perspective.switchTest is also quite fast on Chrom and Firefox , but , surprizingly the slowest in Safari and OperaRegexps with re.test ( str ) perform well everywhere , even fastest in Opera.Hash and branching show almost identically poor results almost everywhere . Comparision is also similar , often worst performance ( this may be due to the implementation , check for ' ' should be the first one ) .To sum up , for my case I 'll opt to the following regexp version : Reasons : branchless version is cool in Chrome and Firefox but is n't quite portableswitch is too slow in Safariregexps seem to perform well everywhere , they 'll also very compact in code"

So , I switched to a much cleaner directive : but the only way I could get the directive element to respond to the zoom change is to add a watch to the zoom inside the link for the element : I know that you are n't supposed to abuse watches , and my fear is that with 500 elements in the gallery you are doing 500 watches .

"Note : I am using AngularJS v1.6.0I have implemented a stand-alone AngularJS app into another existing website , it exists on a single page on the site and the rest of the site does n't have any Angular code running on it.For example , a regular page on the site could be at : http : //example.com/any-pageThen the user can click on a link and it takes them to the page with the Angular JS running on it : http : //example.com/angularjs-appWhen landing on this URL it loads the AngularJS app and appends # ! / to the URL as expected . It does n't contain any elements from the rest of the site such as the header , so for the user it looks like a completely different section . However it also breaks the back button . It 's not possible press back to go back to http : //example.com/any-page . Each time you press back , it just loads the landing view of the AngularJS app again - effectively the user is stuck on the AngularJS app page and can not go back to /any-page.I think this has something to do with AngularJS routing , because it seems to refresh the # ! / portion of the URL when you press back , and just reload the initial view on the app . But I could be wrong . Note that the back button works fine within the AngularJS app when visiting various routes . For example , if I navigate between various routes/views in the app , such as # ! /login or # ! /view-details , I can always go back through these views via the back button . But when it reaches that initial view , it stops working.Does anyone know a way around this ? Note : I have looked at various other Stack Overflow posts on this , however they all seem to be concered with the back button not working at all , rather than this issue where the back button works for navigating between routes within the app , but not back to the original non-AngularJS page on the site.Routing configPortion of index where ng-view lives : StartCtrl"

"I have an Angular 5 library that I expose as a package for other apps to consume from their node_modules.Currently , the app is Just-in-Time ( JIT ) compiled using rollup and gulp and exported as a package . So developer applications use my package in their JIT compiled form.Researching about AOT has led me to believe that any Angular app which when AOT compiled is much more performant than its JIT counterpart on the browser . However , as a library developer , I would like to know if app developers will get any performance benefit if I were to expose my library AOT compiled ? I use ng-bootstrap and a lot of other open-source libraries to create components in my module and add custom styling or functionalities on top of them . Do all the libraries I consume in my module also need to be in their AOT forms or I could use their JIT counterparts ? Also , I think it would be a good idea to have separate packages for my library - packageName and packageName-aot so that the users have an option to choose whichever library they want to use.Apart from the entire code refactoring ( changing the private variables used in the template to public , removing arrow functions , lambda expressions etc . ) , is there anything else I need to keep in mind before exposing my library modules in AOT form ? I can not use the Angular CLI due to certain constraints , so will have to depend on @ ngtools/webpack to get AOT compilation if any.Currently , my tsconfig.json has the following options : I have searched a lot on the internet , but the Angular AOT docs are pretty vague and are not very clear for what I have been trying to do here .

"I 'm wondering if there 's any consensus out there with regard to how best to handle GraphQL field arguments when using Dataloader . The batchFn batch function that Dataloader needs expects to receive Array < key > and returns an Array < Promise > , and usually one would just call load ( parent.id ) where parent is the first parameter of the resolver for a given field . In most cases , this is fine , but what if you need to provide arguments to a nested field ? For example , say I have a SQL database with tables for Users , Books , and a relationship table called BooksRead that represent a 1 : many relationship between Users : Books.I might run the following query to see , for all users , what books they have read : Let 's say that there 's a BooksReadLoader available within the context , such that the resolver for books_read might look like this : The batch load function for the BooksReadLoader would make an async call to a data access layer method , which would run some SQL like : We would create some Book instances from the resulting rows , group by user_id , then return keys.map ( fn ) to make sure we assign the right books to each user_id key in the loader 's cache.Now suppose I add an argument to books_read , asking for all the books a user has read that were published before 1950 : In theory , we could run the same SQL statement , and handle the argument in the resolver : But , this is n't ideal , because we 're still fetching a potentially huge number of rows from the Books table , when maybe only a handful of rows actually satisfy the argument . Much better to execute this SQL statement instead : My question is , does the cacheKeyFn option available via new DataLoader ( batchFn [ , options ] ) allow the field 's argument to be passed down to construct a dynamic SQL statement in the data access layer ? I 've reviewed https : //github.com/graphql/dataloader/issues/75 but I 'm still unclear if cacheKeyFn is the way to go . I 'm using apollo-server-express . There is this other SO question : Passing down arguments using Facebook 's DataLoader but it has no answers and I 'm having a hard time finding other sources that get into this.Thanks !"

"This is actually more a question about the object-orientation model in ES6 . However I am going to use the creation of a new custom element as an example.So the new and shiny ( as of today ) method to create a new custom element is via customElements.define ( ) which take in a tag name , a constructor , and options ( which is optional ) according to MDN , Google , and of course the spec . All the documentation listed uses a variation of the new class keyword for constructor.Assuming I do n't like the new class syntax , and considering for most part class is a syntatic sugar ( according to this tutorial ) . The spec even specifically state that A parameter-less call to super ( ) must be the first statement in the constructor body , to establish the correct prototype chain and this value before any further code is run.By reading the tutorial I came out with this to try if it is possible ( also to revise and re-learn Javascript 's object model ) .I am getting this error Error : The custom element being constructed was not registered with customElements.So my question is , is it possible to do it without using class keyword ( also without new if possible ) ?

"Why is using componentDidUpdate more recommended over the setState callback function ( optional second argument ) in React components ( if synchronous setState behavior is desired ) ? Since setState is asynchronous , I was thinking about using the setState callback function ( 2nd argument ) to ensure that code is executed after state has been updated , similar to then ( ) for promises . Especially if I need a re-render in between subsequent setState calls.However , the official React Docs say `` The second parameter to setState ( ) is an optional callback function that will be executed once setState is completed and the component is re-rendered . Generally we recommend using componentDidUpdate ( ) for such logic instead . '' And that 's all they say about it there , so it seems a bit vague . I was wondering if there was a more specific reason it is recommended to not use it ? If I could I would ask the React people themselves.If I want multiple setState calls to be executed sequentially , the setState callback seems like a better choice over componentDidUpdate in terms of code organization - the callback code is defined right there with the setState call . If I use componentDidUpdate I have to check if the relevant state variable changed , and define the subsequent code there , which is less easy to track . Also , variables that were defined in the function containing the setState call would be out of scope unless I put them into state too.The following example might show when it might be tricky to use componentDidUpdate : vsAlso , apart from componentDidUpdate being generally recommended , in what cases would the setState callback be more appropriate to use ?"

I also have no idea what to set as the return type of the second example.Thank you !"

I am new to JSONP development and I find out that IE 7/8 will not clean up the memory of which JSONP script takes . This leads to very high memory consumption in my page after running a couple of hours.I looked around the Internet and found most of the fixes are based on the tip from Neil Fraser . From the blog it is said that you need to delete all the properties in the script by using code likeUnfortunately the deletion will create error of `` Object does not support this action '' in IE and it will not free the memory.So my question is how to really free the memory of my JSONP script ? I put my testing code as below : Testing.htmlmemoryleaktest.jsYou can recreate the memory leak by pasting the code into two files and open the Testing.html.I used the Drip to track the leaks and in Drip you can see that the memory keeps increasing and the `` < `` script '' > '' is not deleted.Thank you very much for any help !

It seems to me that it would be better to store the colors as an embedded object within the user document , rather than an array within the user document .

"All , I am studying Ajax using the Head First Ajax book . In the first chapter they give some code example which I simplified a bit . I added a bunch of alert to understand what was happening .

When I run the above , the code seems to run through the displayDetails ( ) function twice . I first get the displayDetails1 alert signaling I 've entered the function . I then get the alerts related to the readyState not being 4 , then not being 4 again , then being 4 ( Request.readyState is 4 ) . Then the status alert tells me the status is 200 . Up to now , nothing unexpected.After that I get something weird . I get the displayDetails2 alert , then the page is modified according to the function and I get the displayDetails3 alert . I then expect to exit the function . Instead I get again the displayDetails1 , Request.readyState is 4 ( a second time ! ) , Request.status is 200 , displayDetails2 , and displayDetails3 alerts , as if the entire function had run a second time . Why is that ? PS:1 ) After the 2nd round , I then get the getDetails6 alert I expect.2 ) The page functions as it should - from a user 's standpoint there 's nothing unusual if the alerts are disabled.3 ) I am developing locally on WampServer , on a WinXP machine ( I know ... ) .4 ) If I add : to my script the log only registers one readyState is 4 ...

I can however for the life of me not figure out which one it is and what.Side notes : I know there is also a ES6-Version of deepdash , and apparently when using both of those the webpack mechanics work fine ( as is stated in the response to the github issue I opened over at deepdash for this ) , but the dependency I am using is not using those . Also , I do not really see ( or understand ? ) the point of having a dedicated ES6 version there in the first place.The very same code ( using deepdash this way with lodash ) works just fine when executed on node.js , where it is not bundled with webpack before , obiously . I should mention it is using the require-syntax here though ."

"My question begins with another one , asked here : Gulp : How to set dest folder relative to processed file ( when using wildcards ) ? I have a similar situation , where I need to make compressed versions on a per-module basis . That is , I haveand I need to have gulp copy the files into relative directories so I end up withI have the following gulp taskHowever , when I run it , I end up withI see in the docs where it says cwd - Specify the working directory the folder is relative to . base - Specify the folder relative to the cwd . Default is where the glob begins . This is used to determine the file names when saving in .dest ( ) I have several questions , specifically about .src ( ) , .dest ( ) and the path and file objects . ( That is , although I 'm sure there are other ways to achieve my end goal , this question is specifically about the behavior of the sample gulp code above and the functions mentioned so I can understand their behavior and API better . ) QuestionsWhen the docs say `` the working directory the folder is relative to '' , what folder is this ? on that same note , in relation to this comment and the spot in the docs where it says `` base - Specify the folder relative to the cwd . Default is where the glob begins '' what does `` where the glob begins '' mean ? My understanding of 'glob ' is that it 's the whole string , but does it really mean a * character within that string ? So for 'some/folder/**/*.js ' with a file existing at some/folder/a/b/c/foo.js I 'm not sure if the base is some/folder/ , some/folder/a/ , or some/folder/a/b/c/ ? is there a way to say < where the glob begins > + '.. ' ? where I 'm saying path.join ( path.dirname ( file.path ) , 'compressed ' ) I 'm assuming that 's producing C : \blah\ui\test\one\compressed . It follows then that whatever 's decided the actual name of the file has one\script1.js in mind . How do I change its mind so that it 's only thinking of script1.js ? Note : I tried doing the following ( using gulp-debug ) The console has the following output for this version of the task : So it appears that the rename has no effect on the path . I also tried modifying path.dirname in the rename pipe , but could n't find anything that would have the desired effect of simply removing the spurious directory name from the final output path.My last question , then , is what exactly do path.basename and path.dirname contain for the path object passed to the rename function ? edit : I found this on how to debug gulp tasks . Doing so with a debugger ; statement placed in the rename function allowed me to inspect the path object , which looks like this : Setting path.dirname to `` in the rename results inso it may be that rename ( ) itself is not useful for what I need . It 's looking more like the base option to .src ( ) may be where the key lies , but the docs are rather terse ."

"I 'm looking for a way to find the average of an unspecified number of colors . I spent a lot of time looking for a way to do this . First I tried converting my colors to CMYK and averaging them , but that did n't provide the result I expected . Then I saw that in several different places , converting the colors to CIE L*a*b* space and then averaging is the preferred way of doing this . So I looked up how to convert RGB colors to LAB space and converted into Javascript the necessary algorithms to make this happen.Now that I have my colors in LAB space , I thought it would be as simple as finding the average of my colors , so I wrote this function to do the trick : If I enter RGB ( 255 , 0 , 0 ) and RGB ( 0 , 0 , 255 ) into the function , I get RGB ( 202 , -59 , 136 ) . This color is nothing near what Color Hexa says is the average of those two RGBs , which is RGB ( 128 , 0 , 128 ) , a.k.a purple . I went back over all my code , and so far I 've managed to determine that the problem does not lie with any of my conversion algorithms by double- and triple-checking them against Color Hexa and EasyRGB . That means either a ) the issue must lie with how I 'm averaging the colors or b ) I 've been misinformed and I should n't attempt to mix colors in CIE L*a*b* space.What exactly am I missing here ? Using my current algorithm , why is averaging RGB ( 255 , 0 , 0 ) and RGB ( 0 , 0 , 255 ) not giving me the same results that Color Hexa ( or even visual estimation ) provides ?

"I know this is not idiomatic React , but I 'm working on a React component ( an inverse scrollview ) which needs to get notified of downstream virtual DOM changes both before they are rendered and after they are rendered.This is a little hard to explain so I made a JSFiddle with a starting point : https : //jsfiddle.net/7hwtxdap/2/My goal is to have the log look like : I 'm aware that React sometimes batches DOM changes and that 's fine ( i.e . the log events could be before update ; rendered big ; rendered big ; after update ; ... ) -- important part is that I am actually notified before and after the DOM changes.I can manually approximate the behavior by specifying callbacks , as done here : https : //jsfiddle.net/7hwtxdap/4/ . However , this approach does not scale—I need , for example , to have events bubble from descendents rather than children ; and would rather not have to add these kind of event handlers to every component I use.Use case : I 'm working on making an `` inverted scrolling component '' for messages ( where , when new elements are added or existing elements change size , the basis for scroll change is from the bottom of the content rather than the top ala every messaging app ) which has dynamically modified children ( similar to the < MyElement / > class but with variable height , data from ajax , etc ) . These are not getting data from a Flux-like state store but rather using a pub-sub data sync model ( approximated pretty well with the setTimeout ( ) ) .To make inverse scrolling work , you need to do something like this : Importantly to this design , I 'd like to be able to wrap the element around other elements that are not `` inverted scrolling aware '' ( i.e . do not have to have special code to notify the inverted scrolling handler that they have changed ) ."

"Since React Hooks , I have decided to let go of React class components . I 'm only dealing with hooks and functional components now.Simple question : I understand the difference between using an arrow function instead of a regular function inside of a class body . The arrow function would automatically bind ( lexical this ) to the instance of my class and I do n't have to bind it in the constructor . This is nice.But since I 'm not dealing with classes anymore , I would like to know what is the difference of doing the following inside of a functional component : QUESTIONBoth works fine . Is there a difference in performance ? Should I favor one way instead of the other ? They 're both recreated on every render , correct ? NOTE ON POSSIBLE DUPLICATESI really do n't think this is a duplicate question .

"We are developing components and when using them , we would like to use the same mechanism like for DOM nodes to conditionally define attributes . So for preventing attributes to show up at all , we set the value to null and its not existing in the final HTML output . Great ! Now , when using our own components , this does not work . When we set null , we actually get null in the components @ Input as the value . Any by default set value will be overwritten . So , whenever we read the type in the component , we get null instead of the 'default ' value which was set . I tried to find a way to get the original default value , but did not find it . It is existing in the ngBaseDef when accessed in constructor time , but this is not working in production . I expected ngOnChanges to give me the real ( default ) value in the first change that is done and therefore be able to prevent that null is set , but the previousValue is undefined . We came up with some ways to solve this : defining a default object and setting for every input the default value when its nulladdressing the DOM element in the template again , instead of setting null defining set / get for every input to prevent null settingbut are curious , if there are maybe others who have similar issues and how it got fixed . Also I would appreciate any other idea which is maybe more elegant . Thanks !"

"BackgroundI am working on a Meteor app that uses ReactJS as the rendering library.Currently , I 'm having trouble with having a Child component re-render when data has been updated , even though the parent is accessing the updated data & supposedly passing it down to the child.The Parent component is a Table of Data . The Child component is a Click-to-edit date field.The way it ( theoretically ) works : Parent component passes the existing data for date into child component as a prop . Child component takes that existing props data , handles it & sets some states using it and then has 2 options : default : display dataif user clicks on data field : change to input & allow user to select date ( using react-datepicker ) , changing the state -- when user clicks outside of field , triggers a return to display only & saves the updated data from state to databaseI am using the child component twice per row in the table , and each time it is used , it needs access to the most current date data from the database . So if it the data is changed in one field , the second field should reflect that change.ProblemThe second field is not reflecting changes in the database unless I manually refresh the page and force the child component to render with the new data . The edited field is reflecting the data change , because it 's reflecting what 's stored in state.After reading React documentation , I am sure the problem is because the date is coming in as a prop , then being handled as a state -- and because the component is n't going to re-render from a prop change.My QuestionWhat do I do to fix this ? All of the reading I 've done of the docs has strongly recommended staying away from things like forceUpdate ( ) and getDerivedStateFromProps ( ) , but as a result I 'm not sure how to have data pass through the way that I want it to.Thoughts ?

"I like how Ruby 's .tap method works . It lets you tap into any method chain without breaking the chain . I lets you operate an object then returns the object so that the methods chain can go on as normal .

"I 'm looking to fit Google AdSense ads into a responsive design ( specifically using Twitter Bootstrap ) .The challenge is that with a responsive design the width of the container can change depending on the width of your browser window .

"Historically , I like to break expressions so that the `` it 's clearly incomplete '' bias is shown on the continued line : This is an attitude that comes from working in languages which need semicolons to terminate expressions . The first line is already obviously incomplete due to no-semicolon , so it 's better to make it clear to the reader that the second line is not complete.The alternative would be : That 's not as good for me . Now the only way to tell that baz ( mumble ) ; is n't standalone ( indentation aside ) is to scan your eyes to the end of the previous line . * ( Which is presumably long , as you needed to break it in the first place . ) *But in bizarro JavaScript land , I started seeing people changing code from things that looked like the first form to the second , and warning about `` automatic semicolon insertion '' . It certainly causes some surprising behaviors . Not really wanting to delve into that tangent at the time I put `` learn what automatic semicolon insertion is and whether I should be doing that too '' into my infinite task queue.When I did look into it , I found myself semi-sure ... but not certain ... that there are n't dangers with how I use it . It seems the problems would come from if I had left off the + on accident and written : ... then JavaScript inserts a semicolon after foo + bar for you , seemingly because both lines stand alone as complete expressions . I deduced perhaps those other JavaScript programmers thought biasing the `` clearly intentionally incomplete '' bit to the end of the line-to-be-continued was better , because it pinpointed the location where the semicolon wasn't.Yet if I have stated my premise correctly , I am styling my broken lines in a way that the ensuing lines are `` obviously incomplete '' . If that were n't the case then I would n't consider my way an advantage in the first place.Am I correct , that my way is not a risk for the conditions I describe of how I use line continuations ? Are there any `` incomplete seeming '' expression pitfalls that are actually complete in surprising Ways ? To offer an example of `` complete in surprising ways '' , consider if + 1 ; could be interpreted as just positive one on a line by itself . Which it seems it can : But JSFiddle gives back 6 for this : Maybe that 's just a quirk in the console , but it causes me to worry about my `` it 's okay so long as the second line does n't stand alone as complete expression '' interpretation ."

Basically , for now , only features needed are indeed crop and resize.I have been checking a few jQuery plugins like JCrop etc . and it seems there 's no plugins doing both things at same time . Lots of croppers OR resizer , but not the two features on a same `` natural '' image view at same time . By natural I mean that examples like this ( bottom right ) are not very nice visually for users : http : //jsfiddle.net/opherv/74Jep/33/Although I guess this would be a possible way to go to have the two features at same time . Though you can see this example only zooms too currently and it is qualified as using `` ugly hacks '' by the author himself to do so : We are rather looking for the possibilty to use a cropper frame/zone ( as we see the most often on the web ) + a zoom/de-zoom option on the image ( handles on the border of the image for example ) Since we only need those two features we thought we would code this from scratch or almost as we do n't want to add other javascript files/plugins which will be overkill anyway being packed with other features we will not need ( at least for now ) . The question is : is there a specific difficulty at trying to code the display of an image re-sizable by straightforward handles & croppable by a frame/zone selection ( which would also be re-sizable on its own and draggable around so a user can fine tune which part of the image he wants ) ? Are we definitely better separating the two features ? Thanks a lot for your help ."

"A poker deck has 52 cards and thus 52 ! or roughly 2^226 possible permutations.Now I want to shuffle such a deck of cards perfectly , with truly random results and a uniform distribution , so that you can reach every single one of those possible permutations and each is equally likely to appear.Why is this actually necessary ? For games , perhaps , you do n't really need perfect randomness , unless there 's money to be won . Apart from that , humans probably wo n't even perceive the `` differences '' in randomness.But if I 'm not mistaken , if you use shuffling functions and RNG components commonly built into popular programming languages , you will often get no more than 32 bits of entropy and 2^32 states . Thus , you will never be able to reach all 52 ! possible permutations of the deck when shuffling , but only about ... 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005324900157 % ... of the possible permutations . That means a whole lot of all the possible games that could be played or simulated in theory will never actually be seen in practice.By the way , you can further improve the results if you do n't reset to the default order every time before shuffling but instead start with the order from the last shuffle or keep the `` mess '' after a game has been played and shuffle from there.Requirements : So in order to do what is described above , one needs all of the following three components , as far as I have understood : A good shuffling algorithm that ensures a uniform distribution.A proper RNG with at least 226 bits of internal state . Since we 're on deterministic machines , a PRNG will be all we 'll get , and perhaps this should be a CSPRNG.A random seed with at least 226 bits of entropy.Solutions : Now is this achievable ? What do we have ? Fisher-Yates shuffle will be fine , as far as I can see.The xorshift7 RNG has more than the required 226 bits of internal state and should suffice.Using window.crypto.getRandomValues we can generate the required 226 bits of entropy to be used as our seed . If that still is n't enough , we can add some more entropy from other sources.Question : Are the solutions ( and also the requirements ) mentioned above correct ? How can you implement shuffling using these solutions in JavaScript in practice then ? How do you combine the three components to a working solution ? I guess I have to replace the usage of Math.random in the example of the Fisher-Yates shuffle with a call to xorshift7 . But that RNG outputs a value in the [ 0 , 1 ) float range and I need the [ 1 , n ] integer range instead . When scaling that range , I do n't want to lose the uniform distribution . Moreover , I wanted about 226 bits of randomness . If my RNG outputs just a single Number , is n't that randomness effectively reduced to 2^53 ( or 2^64 ) bits because there are no more possibilities for the output ? In order to generate the seed for the RNG , I wanted to do something like this : Is this correct ? I do n't see how I could pass randomBytes to the RNG as a seed in any way , and I do n't know how I could modify it to accep this ."

"I 'm zooming out the contents of my awesome graph editor using transform : scale ( x ) . When zooming-out the scale goes down towards 0 ( exclusive ) , when zooming-in the scale goes up , up to a maximum of 1 ( inclusive ) which means full zoom or initial scale.However , when zoomed-out considerably , image quality starts becoming really noisy -- please consider the following example , and notice how zooming out will make image appearance noisy : Demo also on JSFiddleThis image is a canvas-drawn shape that interactively visualizes a connection between two graph nodes , exported into png.Please zoom out and see how noisy that line is , even though zooming is done in steps of 0.25 and with CSS . How can I get rid of this pixel-noise ? The issue happens in both the latest Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge , untested in other browsers . The issue happens with and without 3D GPU acceleration . Note : obviously , this is a Minimal , Complete , and Verifiable example and the real work is magnitudes more complex . Hundrends of line shapes are drawn procedurally onto a canvas ( < 1ms per line ) and then cached to img elements asynchronously using toDataUrl ( ~40ms per line ) when idle , so that screen panning -- which is also a required feature -- works more smoothly , as moving an img element on the screen is much cheaper than moving a canvas element ( or redrawing all lines on a single canvas ) , whether it 's the element itself , the container , or the browser viewport that is translated into a given direction . As such , generating mipmaps is not really an option , or only as a last resort , as it will come with a significant performance penalty ( each mip-level would have to be cached onto a separate image , cutting performance in half at the very least ) . I 'd like to believe it can be avoided , though . Redrawing line shapes on each zoom step will mercillesly obliterate performance down to a slideshow.The following is the list of things I tried , no effect : Hinting at better image quality by defining the following CSS property values , on the shapes elements itself , or the container : Forcing elevating the rendering layer into GPU acceleration with a dummy transformUsing scale3d instead of scaleHalving img.width and img.height and then compensating by doubling img.style.width and img.style.heightNot caching canvas results into img and instead displaying the canvas element directly ( slower performance , same bad quality ) I also tried using filter : blur when zoomed out , but it did not yield a better quality , as the blur effect itself is applied after the given shape has been rendered on screen.What else can I do to get rid of this pixel-noise , besides creating downsampled versions of each shape , effectively creating a software-rendered mipmap ( LOD ) system ? ( which , as I wrote , would like to strongly avoid ) How is this question different from the array of similar questions investigating bad image quality from downscaling ? Here , it 's the container that is downscaled ( and with CSS transformations ) , instead of individual image elements . No manipulation is done to actual image data , which is what is discussed in similar topics ."

I am using same form and same state in redux for add and edit . When I call api for fetching data for edit and we change our router to add form before the response arrives . All the form datas will be auto filled for add item since i am using same state for both add and edit .

"From the selected answer in this SO-question this very ingenious function creates an Array with a range from 1 to i : It works perfect . Call me stupid , but I just ca n't get my head around how it works . Let 's say we have range1 ( 5 ) . Now entering the function , we have i , so it returns itself with parameter i-1 ( 4 ) and concats i ( 5 ) to it . But here I 'm stuck : how does range1 know it has to do with an Array ? I 'd say after the first run the return value ( as long as we have i , so i ! ==0 ) would be a Number . And Number has no concat method . Can someone explain this ? What am I missing ?"

I am writing a basic CRUD React app that uses Firebase for authentication . At the moment I am trying to create a protected route for a component named Dashboard . The protected route insures that any encapsulated routes ( such as the Dashboard ) do not render unless the user is authenticated.If the user is not authenticated then the router redirects to the landing page.The way that I am accomplishing this is modelled on this article : I have emulated the pattern in the article above and it works fine . When I incorporate firebase ( specifically firebase authentication ) my app does not render the Dashboard component even when a user has logged in . Instead it simply redirects to the landning pageI know what the problem is ( I think ) but I am unsure how to fix it.The problem is that the call to firebase is an async operation and the dashboard attempts to load before the call to firebase is resolved.I want to know if their are any tweaks to my code I can make to fix this.I could make an api call to firebase every time the user loads a protected route ( to check for authentication ) but I would prefer to set the authentication on the state of the Context and reference that state until the user either logs in or logs out.I 've placed the relevant code below . All files are in the src directoryThank you ! App.jsPageComponents/Context.jsPageComponents/DashboardPageComponents/ProtectedRouteservices/authentication

"When a module is required in node.js more than once it gives back the same object because require ( ) cache the previous calls.Lets say I have a main logger module what could register the sub logger modules . ( Those make the logging actually through the main logger module log ( ) function . But its not related here . ) I have something like this in the main logger module to add a sub-module : When I create a redis client instance , I could immediately add a logger to it like this : In the sub module I start to log like this : And stop logging like this : But as far as I understand , with this technique I could only assign one redis logger instance because assigning the second one would return in the require ( ) with the same object as in the first , so passing the new redis parameter would override the previous value . Because of that it would not be possible to stop the logging in the first redis logger instance because calling it , would stop the logging in the second instance . Lets see an example : I except to get this output : We should get this because the first logger now points to the second instance . So the redis points to the second client too.But instead I get this : So it works as expected by PROGRAM DESIGN but not as expected by CODE . So I want to make it works as it works now , but I do n't understand why it works like that . UPDATE : Long Versionmodule.jsmain.jsRunning the main.js will result this output : So require ( ) gives back the very same object as the first time .

When the constructor runs the second time it overrides the first one , that is why I except to get the notifications from the logger of the first redis client , because there is no reference pointing at it , so the listener could n't be removed ."

"I 'm starting to make use of virtual getter methods in Mongoose in a real-world application and am wondering if there is a performance impact to using them that would be good to know about up-front.For example : Basically , I do n't understand yet how the getters are generated into the Objects Mongoose uses , and whether the values are populated on object initialisation or on demand.__defineGetter__ can be used to map a property to a method in Javascript but this does not appear to be used by Mongoose for virtual getters ( based on a quick search of the code ) .An alternative would be to populate each virtual path on initialisation , which would mean that for 100 users in the example above , the method to join the first and last names is called 100 times . ( I 'm using a simplified example , the getters can be much more complex ) Inspecting the raw objects themselves ( e.g . using console.dir ) is a bit misleading because internal methods are used by Mongoose to handle translating objects to 'plain ' objects or to JSON , which by default do n't include the getters.If anyone can shed light how this works , and whether lots of getters may become an issue at scale , I 'd appreciate it ."

"I am new to unit testing so I might be missing something , but how am I supposed to structure requirejs modules in order to make them fully testable ? Consider the elegant revealing module pattern.As far as I am aware of this is the most common pattern for building requirejs modules . Please correct me if I am wrong ! So in this simplistic scenario I can easily test return values and behavior of func1 since it is global . However , in order to test func2 I also would have to return it 's reference . Right ? This makes the code slightly less pretty , but overall is still ok . However , if I wanted to mock func2 and replace its return value by using Jasmine spy I would not be able to since that method is inside a closure.So my question is how to structure requirejs modules to be fully testable ? Are there better patterns for this situation than revealing module pattern ?"

"In modern browsers , jQuery makes use of document.querySelectorAll ( ) to boost performance when valid CSS selectors are used . It falls back to Sizzle if a browser does n't support the selector or the document.querySelectorAll ( ) method.However , I 'd like to always use Sizzle instead of the native implementation when debugging a custom selector . Namely , I 'm trying to come up with an implementation of : nth-last-child ( ) , one of the CSS3 selectors that are not supported by jQuery . Since this selector is natively supported by modern browsers , it works as described in the linked question . It is precisely this behavior that 's interfering with debugging my custom selector , though , so I 'd like to avoid it.A cheap hack I can use is to drop in a non-standard jQuery selector extension , thereby `` invalidating '' the selector so to speak . For example , assuming every li : nth-last-child ( 2 ) is visible , I can simply drop that in , turning this : Into this : This causes it to always be evaluated by Sizzle . Except , this requires that I make an assumption of my page elements which may or may not be true . And I really do n't like that . Not to mention , I dislike using non-standard selectors in general unless absolutely necessary.Is there a way to skip the native document.querySelectorAll ( ) method in browsers that support it and force jQuery to use Sizzle to evaluate a selector instead , that preferably does n't employ the use of non-standard selectors ? Likely , this entails calling another method instead of $ ( ) , but it 's much better than a selector hack IMO ."

"We 're trying to make a generic approach for a piece of software we are developing that ties into form fields.So far so good but we 're running in to an edge case that prevents submitting a form/field that has another handler tied in to it . Here 's the ( condensed ) use case : HTML : Normal behaviour is that when a user types 'foo ' into the field and hits enter , the form is handled and submitted to the correct 'endpoint ' which is n't necessarily the defined one in the form 's opening tag . There could be some function ( from somewhere else ) that handles this enter-event.Unfortunately , we ca n't predict what that function is , we like to keep it generic.In the above HTML , clicking on the link should trigger an enter-event on the form field that mimics the browser/user behaviour and thus some unknown handler.This is our Javscript ( we 're using jquery ) : When entering 'foo ' in the field and pressing enter the form gets submitted .

"I am exploring vue.js and have a question regarding how a certain problem can be addressed.My root component has the following template : Basically , < player > component has < video > element inside that will load the specified track ( with native controls hidden ) . As such , it will in reality drive the state of the application as the video plays through ( current time , playback state , etc ) . However , < control-panel > has a scrub bar and buttons that dictate the video state ( play/pause , seek ) . Obviously , altering this general state in one of the components will affect the other two components ( map will also progress according to the current time ) .However , I wonder if it would make more sense and whether Vue supports providing references to components so that I could provide < control-panel > with a reference to < player > so that it could take the state changes directly from it.Or should this be done in a kind of global-state-passed-down-to-children or a event-broadcast way ? Before I am corrected , consider an example where there are two < player > s and two < control-panel > s that are not hierarchically related but one panelA works with playerA and panelB with playerB . In this case , I think broadcast option falls off the table , correct ? Any suggestions are welcome especially so as I 'm just learning Vue.Update 1So after getting a bit more familiar with Vue and hearing back from the community , I think I 've come up with a clever solution for syncing < player > and < control-panel > together . My markup changes to the following : Notice the addition of v-ref attributes to < player > and < control-panel > as well as : player= '' $ refs.player '' attribute in the latter . This allows me to tie logically together one to another . In my head , it makes sense for control panel to know who or what it is controlling . I 'm going to test it out further but , for now , this seems to work.As for tying together < map > , I will end up using broadcasting or simply two-way currentTime updated by < control-panel > .

I 've always wondered since i learned about prototype inheritance why you push an instance of the parent class into the child prototype and not the prototype itself ? Why not do the inheritance like this ? My guess is that with only inheriting the prototype you are n't including the properties created in the constructor ( this.type ) but I 'm not entirely sure . Anyone want to enlighten me ? But is n't putting an instance into the child class prototype putting all constructor-defined properties in the prototype too and thus introducing possible pitfalls ? I 'm thinking about the fact that the prototype properties are shared among all instances of a class unless they are defined in the constructor .

"Previously , I used $ sce.trustAsHtml ( aString ) to inject a string ( eg , < html > ... < /html > ) to a template < div ng-bind-html= '' content '' > < /div > to display a graph when loading a generated URL : Now , the html to generate a graph contains references to other files , eg , < script src= '' script.js '' > < /script > . So I need a folder of files ( .html , .css , .js ) to draw a graph . I can put the whole folder in my server , but the problem is how to inject these files to the template . I tried templateUrl : 'http : //localhost:3000/tmp/ZPBSytN5GpOwQN51AAAD/index.html ' , loading localhost:3000/ # /urls/58b8c55b5d18ed6163324fb4 in the browser does load the html page . However , script.js is NOT loaded , an error Failed to load resource : the server responded with a status of 404 ( Not Found ) is shown in the console log.Does anyone know how to amend this ? Otherwise , is there any other ways to say something like src=http : //localhost:3000/tmp/ZPBSytN5GpOwQN51AAAD/index.html ( like in iframe ) ?

"Note : I understand that other libraries ( e.g. , Marionette ) could greatly simplify view-based issues . However , let 's assume that that is not an option here.Let 's say that we have a parent view for a given `` record '' ( i.e. , a model ) . That parent view has two subviews , one for displaying the record 's attributes and one for editing them ( assume that editing-in-place is not appropriate in this case ) . Up until now , whenever I needed to remove/display subviews , I literally called remove on the outgoing view and new on the incoming view , so I was destroying/creating them everytime . This was straightforward and easy to code/manage.However , it seemed relevant to figure out if there were any workable alternatives to the ( seemingly default ) approach of removing/creating - especially because it 's been asked a few times before , but never fully answered ( e.g. , Swap out views with Backbone ? ) So I 've been trying to figure out how I could have both subviews share an element in the parent view , preventing me from having to remove and new them everytime . When one needs to be active , it is rendered and the other one is `` silenced '' ( i.e. , does n't respond to events ) . So they are continually swapped out until the parent view is removed , and then they are all removed together.What I came up with can be found here : http : //jsfiddle.net/nLcan/Note : The swapping is performed in RecordView.editRecord and RecordView.onRecordCancel.Although this appears to work just fine , I have a few concerns : ( 1 ) Even if the event bindings are silenced on the `` inactive '' view , might there be a problem for two views to be set the same element ? As long as only the `` active '' view is rendered , it does n't seem like this should be an issue . ( 2 ) When the two subviews have remove called ( i.e. , Backbone.View.remove ) it calls this. $ el.remove . Now , when the first subview is removed , this will actually remove the DOM element that they were both sharing . Accordingly , when remove is called on the second subview there is no DOM element to remove , and I wonder if that might make it difficult for that subview to clean itself up - especially if it had created a number of DOM elements itself that were then over-written when the first subview was rendered ... . or if there are sub-sub-views involved ... it seems like there might be a potential concern regarding memory leaks here.Apologies , as I know this is a little convoluted . I 'm RIGHT at the boundary of my knowledge base , so I do n't fully understand all the potential issues involved here ( hence the question ) . But I do hope someone out there has dealt with a similar issue and can offer an informed opinion on all this.Anyhow , here is the ( simplified example ) code in full :"

"I 'm trying to write a simple Web Extension.Currently I 'm following the various tutorials and trying to understand the architecture.Interaction with specific tabs is done with content_scripts that are injected into the source code of a website.It seems to me , as if content_scripts are loaded automatically : https : //developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension # Content_scriptsA tutorial on MDN makes this even more clear : This script will be loaded into the pages that match the pattern given in the content_scripts manifest.json key .

"I have no clue how to even begin explaining this situation but I 'll try my best .

That 's just like any online dictionary service functions . It works perfect except that the second functionality does n't seem to work on the first click after a typed search . For example : You type pedir in the input box and hit Lookup . The div below now shows the detailed meaning of pedir including hyperlinked words like ask , English for pedir . Now , you click ask which should refresh the div and show you the Spanish meanings of ask including words like pedir . However , it just refreshes the div and shows the same content as if you looked up pedir a second time . But when you click on ask a second time now , it works fine as expected .

'' . The way I understand it , a `` job queue '' is linked to an entry on the `` event queue '' . So would that be the setTimeout entry in above example ? Assuming no other events are added to the `` event queue '' before ( and after ) setTimeout 's callback is added , would n't the entry for the main code ( the call to foo ) have been ( usually ) gone ( run to completion ) by that time and thus there would be no other entry than setTimeout 's for the then 's `` job queue '' entry to be linked to ?"

"In Nicholas Zakas ' book , he explains the problem of circular referencing when using reference counting for garbage collection in Javascript . He uses the following example : explaining that the two objects will never have the memory allocated to them freed since they have two references to them inside the function . I would like some clarification of how this works.Clearly , there are two references to each object . The first object has both objectA and objectB.anotherObject pointing to it . The situation is analogous for the second object . So the reference count for each object is 2 . But what happens when the function is exited ? This is n't really described in the book . He says that the reference count is decremented whenever a reference to the value is overwritten with another value . I think this means : But what happens when the function exits ? As far as I understand , both objectA and objectB and their respective properties that reference each other will be destroyed , and thus , the two objects ' reference counts will be decremented by 2 . I do n't see the `` circular reference problem '' that Zakas talks about . Could somebody explain what he 's trying to say ?"

Since in that thread it was mentioned for loops are slower than while and loops with decrementing iterator are faster so I rewrote the code for better performance.Here 's the new version with for replaced with while and conditions edited for decrementing : But to my surprise this code had even worse performance .

Each app usually has it 's own models.py , views.py , urls.py , tests.py . There is no repeating app name inside the script names.I hope I 'm not crossing an opinion-based line and there is a legitimate reason for following the approach ."

"In Webpack 1.x I used to do the following on regular basis : With this technique , we were able to transfer a webpack-bundle over the wire , but evaluate the actual contents ( the JavaScript code ) from that bundle at some later point in time . Also , using require.ensure we could name the bundle , in this case myModule2 , so we could see the name / alias when bundling happened executing webpack.In Webpack 2.x , the new way to go is using System.import . While I love receiving a Promise object now , I have two issues with that style . The equivalent of the above code would look like : How can we split the transfer and the evaluation now ? How can we still name the bundle ? The Webpack documentation on Github says the following : Full dynamic requires now fail by default A dependency with only an expression ( i. e. require ( expr ) ) will now create an empty context instead of an context of the complete directory . Best refactor this code as it wo n't work with ES6 Modules . If this is not possible you can use the ContextReplacementPlugin to hint the compiler to the correct resolving.I 'm not sure if that plays a role in this case .

"When coding new javascript heavy websites , which order or web browser do you code for ? I can see these possible orders , but I am not sure which I like best : Code for one first and get it working well , then start testing with other and fix errors as I go.This will allow for the most rapid development ( with Firefox at least ) but I 've learned from experience that debugging IE with so much going on at once can be a pain ! Code for both at the same time . In other words , for each new feature , ensure it works with both browsers before moving on.This seems like it will actually take more time , so maybe do several features in Firefox then move to IE to patch them up.What do you all do ? Edit 1 : To respond to a couple of answers here . : @ JQuery usage : For some reason I was not expecting this kind of a response , however , now that this seems to be the overwhelming accepted answer , I guess I should tell everyone a few more things about the specifics of my app . This is actually the DynWeb that I started another question for , and as I 'm developing , a lot of the important code seems to require that I use document.whatever ( ) instead of any JQuery or Prototype functions that I could find . Specifically , when dynamically importing changing CSS , I have to use some similar to : And I expect that I will have to continue to use this kind of raw coding currently unsupported by either JQuery or Prototype in the future . So while I would normally accept JQuery as an answer , I can not as it is not a solution for this particular webapp . @ Wedge and bigmattyh : As the webapp is supposed to build other webapps , part of the criteria is that anything it builds look and work functionally the same in whatever browsers I support ( right now I 'm thinking Firefox and IE7/8 atm , maybe more later on ) . So as this is a more interesting ( and much more complicated ) problem ; are there any sites , references , or insights you may have for specific trouble areas ( css entities , specific javascript pitfalls and differences , etc . ) and how to avoid them ? I 'm almost certain that I am going to have to have some sort of isIE variable and simply perform different actions based on that , but I would like to avoid it as much as possible.Thanks for your input so far !

Source - InstallThe problem occurs at line 85 , the line after the 'vodoo ' comment : It might look a little weird , but the + in front of the two variables and the inner bracket is for type coercion , the inner middle + is for addition , and the other ones are for concatenation . Nothing special , but observant reader might note that type coercion on the inner bracket is unnecessary , since both are already type coerced to numbers , and type coercing result is useless when they get concatenated into a string anyway . Not so ! Removing the + breaks the script , causing f.offensive and f.spam to be concatenated instead of added together .

I have managed to successfully use the get and list functions of the API but am having problems making the insert function work.Where in this case auth is simply an already authenticated google oauth client that gets passed in from another file.Curiously , when I try to call this function I get the following error : I have scanned through the rest of the response and have not found any additional info . This is strange to me because the other two functions work , I am using oAuth so there should be no problems with API key limiting , and both of the other two API methods work.My oAuth authentication scope :"
"Given an array of arrays , what would be the efficient way of identifying the duplicate item ? I 've been working on this with lodash as an accepted dependency , and I get how to just return the `` unique '' list using _.uniqWith and _.isEqual : With would give the `` unique '' version of the list : But rather than just reporting the unique elements , I need just the element that is duplicated , and ideally the index of the first occurrence.Is this actually covered in the lodash library by some combination of methods that I 'm missing ? Or am I just going to have to live with writing loops to compare elements.Probably just overtired on this , so fresh eyes on the problem would be welcome.Trying not to rewrite functions if there are library methods that suit , so I basically am stuck with : Returning just the duplicate or at least the comparison difference with the `` unique list '' .Basically identifying the `` index of '' an array within an array .

"For some reason , this does n't work at all . { { user_slugged username } } The { { username } } is a variable available to the template .

"Before I dive into the question . Let me state that by Event Loop I am referring to http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop . This is something that browsers implement . For more information , read this : http : //javascript.info/tutorial/further-javascript-features/events-and-timing-depth.This question is hard and long , so , please try to bear with it ! And I do appreciate all answers ! So . Now , as I understand it , in JavaScript there is a single main thread ( in most browser environments , that is ) . So , code like : will produce an animation from black to white , but you wo n't see that because the rendering is done after the code has been processed ( when the next tick happens -- the browser enters the Event Loop ) .If you want to see the animation , you could do : The above example would produce a visible animation , because setTimeout pushes a new event to the browser Event Loop stack which will be processed after there is nothing running ( it enters the Event Loop to see what to do next ) .It seems that the browser in this case have 0xfff ( 4095 ) events pushed into the stack , where each of them are processed with a render process in between them . So , my first question ( # 1 ) is that when exactly does the rendering take place ? Does it always take place in between the processing of two events in the Event Loop stack ? The second question is about the code in the javascript.info website link I gave you.My question here is that will the browser push a new `` rendering '' event to the Event Loop stack every time it reaches the div.style . ... = ... line ? But does it not first push an event due to the setTimeout-call ? So , does the browser end up in a stack like : Since the setTimeout call was processed before the div style change ? If that 's how the stack looks like , then I would assume the next time the browser enters the Event Loop it will process the setTimeout 's callback and end up having : and continue with the rendering event that the earlier setTimeout call produced ?"

"I 've been learning about continuation passing style , particularly the asynchronous version as implemented in javascript , where a function takes another function as a final argument and creates an asychronous call to it , passing the return value to this second function.However , I ca n't quite see how continuation-passing does anything more than recreate pipes ( as in unix commandline pipes ) or streams : vs Except that the piping is much , much cleaner . With piping , it seems obvious that the data is passed on , and simultaneously execution is passed to the receiving program . In fact with piping , I expect the stream of data to be able to continue to pass down the pipe , whereas in CPS I expect a serial process . It is imaginable , perhaps , that CPS could be extended to continuous piping if a comms object and update method was passed along with the data , rather than a complete handover and return.Am I missing something ? Is CPS different ( better ? ) in some important way ? To be clear , I mean continuation-passing , where one function passes execution to another , not just plain callbacks . CPS appears to imply passing the return value of a function to another function , and then quitting ."

The prefix and suffix being quotation marks : The problem is , that i 'm currently using ng-model , which i ofcourse can not use for this .

When the variable , with the original value , then changes , i would write the value with a pre and suffix to another variable , on the scope .

When A changes , i would then take the raw value , put quotes around it and store that new value in another variable , also on the scope . That new variable is called BThe input field would then use ng-bind on the A variable , and show the content from the B variable , using the input fields value attribute .

"When you are writing complex jQuery/javascript , how do you manage using this without re-defining this variables that were previously defined ? Do you have a rule of thumb or a personal preference for naming your this variables ( as the nesting gets deeper ) ? There are times where I want variables from a higher scope to be available to nested functions/callbacks , but then there are times when I 'd like to have a clean slate/scope ; is there a good way to call functions/callbacks without having to worry about variable collisions ? If so , what technique ( s ) do you use ?

Answer : Because the var within that scope is re-defining $ this ; it 's just that I 'm trying to log $ this before its been defined within that scope.If I comment out var $ this = $ ( this ) ; , then the marker ( # 1 ) returns : The same logic applies to markers ( # 2 ) , ( # 3 ) , ( # 4 ) , ( # 5 ) , ( # 6 ) , ( # 7 ) and ( # 8 ) .Based on this observation ( and please correct me if I 'm wrong here ) I 'm assuming that I could put var $ this = $ ( this ) ; at the bottom of the function , and the current scope would know that I want to use the current scope 's $ this ( even though it 's not defined yet ) , and not the parent 's $ this ( even though it IS defined ) .POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO AVOIDING $ this CONFLICTS : If one wants to cache $ ( this ) outside/within other closures/functions/callbacks and avoid collisions , then one should use different variable labels like these ( for example ) : QUESTION : Is the solution above how you would avoid $ this collisions ? If not , what 's your prefered technique ? Observation 2 : Marker ( # 9 ) ... $ this is undefined for reasons mentioned above , but : ... $ this is now $ ( ' # foo ' ) !

"I want to write a test suite to ensure some given functions are using strict mode . There are many of them , and manually inspecting them seems like a chore.An answer in a similar question uses a regex on the function 's definition to check . However , I believe this will misdetect situations where the function being tested is inside a function with `` use strict '' or a file-level `` use strict '' declaration . The answer says that `` use strict '' is prepended , but in my environment ( Mozilla Rhino ) , this is not the case : I feel like the answer is `` no '' , but is there no way to introspect a function to see if it was parsed and found to be strict mode ? Update : One method suggest by @ Amy was to parse the function 's source to figure it out . This works if the function has a use-strict declaration ( although it 's tedious ) , but not if it the strict-mode is propagation from , say , Program-level ; in that case , we have to walk up the AST to the Program level and check that for use strict . To make this robust , we 'd have to implement all the rules for use strict-propagation , which the interpreter already has somewhere . ( Tested in SpiderMonkey : )"

"I have the following question ( this is not school -- just code site practice questions ) and I ca n't see what my solution is missing.A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given . The array contains an odd number of elements , and each element of the array can be paired with another element that has the same value , except for one element that is left unpaired . Assume that : *N is an odd integer within the range [ 1..1,000,000 ] ; *each element of array A is an integer within the range [ 1..1,000,000,000 ] ; *all but one of the values in A occur an even number of times.EX : A = [ 9,3,9,7,9 ] Result : 7The official solution is using the bitwise XOR operator : My first instinct was to keep track of the occurrences of each value in a Map lookup table and returning the key whose only value appeared once .

"I have a service that uses ngDialog ( that 's the only purpose of the service - to show common dialogs : alerts , confirms , etc ) . ngDialog requires scope object to be passed as parameter to interpolate dialog 's template.So I need to create a scope , assign it 's properties and pass to ngDialog.open.The problem is I ca n't inject $ rootScope ( or $ scope ) into service , and scope. $ new is the only way I could find to create an empty scope.When I inject $ rootScope like thisI get error : Unknown provider : $ rootScope Provider < - $ rootScope < - myServiceHowever , this works if I just use shortcut syntack for decalring dependencies : function myService ( $ rootScope , ngDialog ) { // $ rootScope here is accessible } But this approach is not minification-safe.So the question is : how do I create new scope in a service ?

"I 've been having a hell of a time getting the comment count script to work on my react pages . To start , they recommend putting the script in my index.html file , at the bottom of the < body > tag . I 've done this , and seen no result.I have an index.js file which is loading all my components , including the component ( let 's call it ResultComponent.js ) which I want to have the comment count < span > tags in . The < span > tags themselves look like this : So far , so simple . I 'm not using any < a > tags so I have n't got # disqus_thread anywhere . When I load my page , I expect my comment count to go up , but no such luck . To test this , I copied the raw script , unaltered , from the raw count.js script ( which is located here ) . I then pasted it straight into Chrome 's devtools console , and it worked ; all the relevant comment counters went to their appropriate values.EDIT : a day later , more prodding ; I added breakpoints in the actual code in the disqus.com domain . The script in the script tag is running just fine at the right time , except it 's missing variables when it enters the displayCount ( ) function . There 's several variables that just are n't given values so it ca n't go in and populate the comment counts , it always fails out . I have no idea why this fails when it 's called from within my index.html but not when I paste the raw count.js code into my console and do it there . No idea why.To clarify , this is the relevant code : When it runs properly , from my pasting the script into the console , the j variable is defined . When it runs called from index.html , j is undefined , so it fails at the first if . The calling url is exactly the same in both situations : http : //mtg-hunter.disqus.com/count-data.js ? 1=19767 & 1=235597 & 1=373322 & 1=382310 & 1=382841 & 1=382866 & 1=383023 & 1=397543 & 1=397682 & 1=398434 . That gives the b parameter , and when I run the script locally it defines j so that the assignment operator in the if can work ( which is a really weird way of doing it , but ok ) .edit again : I should point out I 'm doing this on a local test server ( localhost:3000 ) , not sure if that makes a difference or not ? edit more : The answer to my above question turns out to be 'no ' . I uploaded my code to my server and the production site also showed that the script was n't running properly . This is absurd ... I 'm out of ideas by now.edit again more : Partial breakthrough ... I added this code to ResultComponent.js : Good news ; when I refresh the page , it shows the right comment count ! Hooray ! Bad news : when I change parts of the page that hide the Result component , and then bring it back ( triggering componentDidUpdate ) , the DISQUSWIDGETS.getCount ( ) call does n't work . It still gets called , but the displayCount part of the script never does , so the DOM is never updated with the new information . It 's yet another example of this horrid script behaving differently despite being called in exactly the same way ..."

"I solved my task , but I do n't like how it works . It looks too heavy for me . If you can suggest me a better way to do exactly the same it would be awesome ! So here is my pain : ) I have a table in SQL DB which contains charts with business data and they are developed by separate department and they are adding them randomly ( at least from my point of view ) . The year range is 1995-2012 ( 3 ) but both of those dates should be flexible because every next month new data appear and they 'll try to add more data for the past.Now it looks like this : To achive this goal I created this model : Here is Controller which contains GetMethod to show View as presented above and Post method to get this Model back parse it and create anothe View with charts.And the last part is actually a View to represent this checkbox field : So user can only choose months of the years if we have charts for them . The year range can change in the future . We must show chart on separate page . We must remember the model ( I keep it in session ) if user decided to go back and select a couple more months.So what I do n't like in this solution:1 . Model is heavy , hard to use , to create and parse . Not easy to add new parameters . 2 . View contains a lot of hidden fields because of model3 . Controller is okay except creation and parse the model.I 'm pretty new for web dev , but I 'm not a newby in software development and I want it look better if it 's possible.I really feel that I 'm missing something here .

"We have been debating how best to handle objects in our JS app , studying Stoyan Stefanov 's book , reading endless SO posts on 'new ' , 'this ' , 'prototype ' , closures etc . ( The fact that there are so many , and they have so many competing theories , suggests there is no completely obvious answer ) .So let 's assume the we do n't care about private data . We are content to trust users and developers not to mess around in objects outside the ways we define.Given this , what ( other than it seeming to defy decades of OO style and history ) would be wrong with this technique ? Obviously : There would be nothing to stop someone from mutating ' p ' in unholyways , or simply the logic of PERSON ending up spread all over the place . ( That is true with the canonical 'new ' technique as well ) .It would be a minor hassle to pass ' p ' in to every function that youwanted to use it.This is a weird approach.But are those good enough reasons to dismiss it ? On the positive side : It is efficient , as ( arguably ) opposed to closures with repetitive function declaration.It seems very simple and understandable , as opposed to fiddling with'this ' everywhere.The key point is the foregoing of privacy . I know I will get slammed for this , but , looking for any feedback . Cheers ."
"I am using the Nodejs Cassandra driver and I want to be able to retrieve the previous and next pages . So far the documentation shows the retrieval of the next page , which is saving the pageState from the previous page and passing it as a parameter . Sadly there is no info on how to navigate to the previous page . As I see it there are two options : Save each pageState and page as a key-value pair and use the pageState for the page that you want to navigate to.Save the retrieved data in an array and use the array to navigate to the previous page . ( I do n't think that this is a good solution as I 'll have to store large chunks the data in the memory . ) Both methods does not seem to be an elegant solution to me , but if I have to choose I 'll use the first one.Is there any way to do this out of the box using the Nodejs Cassandra driver ? Another thing is that in the documentation the manual paging is used by calling the eachRow function . If I understand it correctly it gives you every row as soon as it is red from the database . The problem is that this is implemented in my API and I am returning the data for the current page in the HTTP response . So in order for me to do that I 'll have to push each row to a custom array and then return the array when the data for the current page is retrieved . Is there a way to use execute with the manual paging as the above seems redundant ? ThanksEDIT : This is my data model : I am displaying the data in a grid , so that the user can navigate trough it . As I write this I thought of a way to do this without needing the previous functionality , but nevertheless I think that this is a valid case and it will be great if there is an elegant solution to it ."

"I am very new in JSDoc , and I am trying out Webstorm , so I am also very new on webstorm.I have on one hand an interface declared this way : On another hand , I am developing a module in which I am implementing this interface : The problem I have is that the implementation is apparently not recognized : But if I remove the window.exports.MyImplementation assignation or the return statment , there is no more warning ... .. but I do want to return and store my type from my module ! Is there something I am missing or doing wrong ? ... Edit : Just to bring a bit more confusion to my issue , I was considering using a `` full annotation '' interface declaration ( If it is possible , I am experimenting here ... ) : ... but in this case , you can notice that the `` I '' symbol has disappeared from the left side and if the method is not implemented , I do n't have any warning.BUT the type IInterface is recognized.Edit : I think I just understood something while experimenting other stuffs of jsDoc.The warning is thrown because the check on the implementation is made on the window.exports.MyImplementation . But there is no direct assignation implementing this object in the code.And this is why the warning is disabled when I remove the return statement or the `` exports.MyImplementation '' assignation ... thus , not sure this could be considered as a bug , this may be the pattern I used for my module that does n't match to the pattern expected by WebStorm and maybe also by the JSdoc itself ... ... If someone who has experience in JSDoc and Webstorm could confirm ... ..Another edit : ( significant step here in understanding JSDoc I think ) The annotations have been moved on the targeted field and ... tadaaa ( notice the `` I '' which is still here indicating the interface is indeed implementing ) .My explanation : There could be a logic behind that ... . but honestly I really do n't know if it is relevant : as the documented field will be exported in `` exports.MyImplementation '' at the very end , and this is evident the annotation is more useful here than in the private enclosure . WebStorm has detected the exportation to `` exports.MyImplementation '' , thus is waiting for the documentation on it ... Does it make sense ? ... And another edit ( again ) Investigation , investigation.I have found a quite different solution that allows documentation , completion , validation and no warning , which seems to me a better solution for module exportation :"

Problem : After I upgraded AJV.js to Version 6.4 my vendor bundle includes the `` uri-js '' ESNEXT version instead the ES5 version what breaks IE11 compatibillity.Analysis : I figured that that AJV referes to uri-js with a require ( 'uri-js ' ) call and that uri-js comes in two flavors : /node_modules/uri-js/dist/ : es5esnextFor some reason Webpack ( V 4.8 ) bundles the 'esnext ' flavor of uri-js into my vendor-bundle instead using the 'es5 ' . I could n't find how/where I have to specify that my preferred build target is.Here is my webpack.config.js : package.json : I do understand that my own code gets transpiled to ES5 using the TypeScript ( V 2.8 ) compiler . But what about the node_modules ? Especially the one that already ship a ES5 version within their dist-folder ? In case it matters here my tsconfig.json : I also thought about including Babel to downgrade all node_modules to ES5 but that sounds like an overkill to me especially as the modules have included ES5 flavors already.Questions : Can I specify that I prefere ES5 version of the dist folder for my node_modules ? Maybe in my webpack.config or in package.json ? How does the selection of the right node_modules/ ... /dist/ folders work ?

"I 'm attempting to send lat and lon along with a webcam image and some other data using PHP and javascript- do n't ask , it 's just a small project I started , hoping to learn something .

"I have a complex Shiny app that needs to use custom JavaScript code . The app is made of modules that are called in multiple places with different namespaces . I need some pieces of JavaScript code to be `` modularized '' along with the R code , that is to use module namespaces . I was able to make it work by creating a customized string containing JS code and executing it with shinyjs : :runjs ( ) function ( example below ) . For given example this is a fair solution . However , putting more complex over hundred line JavaScript code into a string that is pasted with the identifiers seem to be very error prone and suboptimal solution ( lack of highlighting , painful formatting etc. ) . Is there a better way to achieve the same effect ? UpdateFor future reference I decided to share the solution that I finally implemented . I ended up creating a single JS file per module containing one function taking the namespace as the only argument . This function creates all the needed objects and bindings using this namespace . I then invoke that single function using shinyjs on the beginning of the module . This allows me to keep JS code in a separate file which solves the initial problems and keeps the code easily manageable ( especially if you have a lot of JS code ) .app.Rwww/myModuleJS.js"

As such , events will need to be established which are aware of both the groups and tickets around them.I 'm using John Resig 's simple JavaScript inheritence setup to establish two classes , Item and Group . When each Item is instantiated it refers back to it 's parent Group . My issue arises when I want to establish my events , and is most easily explained by the following function : Note the use of the .data ( `` _obj '' ) in the above snippet . Essentially , when I need to do something like sorting the items , then I need to know the object ( model ) corresponding to every item 's DOM ( view/controller ) in the group . Now , I could establish my Group class so that when I create each Item I add a reference to it from within my Group ( e.g . so Group.items = [ i1 , i2 ... ] ) , and then rather than iterating over the DOM elements , I could iterate over the Item instances . However I think I 'd run into similar problems down the line , such as when I want to move an Item into a different Group ( as the Group would not know about the Item ) . Long story short : is it intrinsically dangerous/naive/pointless to have a class which when instantiated creates a DOM element , which then in turn points back to the class ? This feels like circular dependency , and some recursive nightmare , but perhaps a reference to an object is n't such a terrible thing . If I 'm doing anything else really stupid , and there 's a much simpler way , then please point that out as well ."
"Note : Additional information appended to end of original question as Edit # 1 , detailing how request-promise in the back-end is causing the UI freeze . Keep in mind that a pure CSS animation is hanging temporarily , and you can probably just skip to the edit ( or read all for completeness ) The setupI 'm working on a desktop webapp , using Electron.At one point , the user is required to enter and submit some data . When they click `` submit '' , I use JS to show this css loading animation ( bottom-right loader ) , and send data asynchronously to the back-end ... - HTML -- JS -where ._hide is simplyand where ipcRenderer.send ( ) is an async method , without option to set otherwise.The problemNormally , the 0ms delay is sufficient to allow the DOM to be changed before the blocking event takes place . But not here . Whether using the setTimeout ( ) or not , there is still a delay.So , add a tiny delay ... Great ! The loader displays immediately upon submitting ! But ... after 100ms , the animation stops dead in its tracks , for about 500ms or so , and then gets back to chooching.This working - > not working - > working pattern happens regardless of the delay length . As soon as the ipcRenderer starts doing stuff , everything is halted.So ... Why ! ? This is the first time I 've seen this kind of behavior . I 'm pretty well-versed in HTML/CSS/JS , but am admittedly new to NodeJS and Electron . Why is my pure CSS animation being halted by the ipcRenderer , and what can I do to remedy this ? Edit # 1 - Additional InfoIn the back-end ( NodeJS ) , I am using request-promise to make a call to an external API . This happens when the back-end receives the ipcRenderer message.The buggy freezing behavior only happens on the first API call . Successive API calls ( i.e . refreshing the desktop app without restarting the NodeJS backend ) , do not cause the hang-up . Even if I call a different API method , there are no issues.For now , I 've implemented the following hacky workaround : First , initialize the first BrowserWindow with show : false ... When the window is ready , send a ping to the external API , and only display the window after a successful response ... This extra step means that there is about 500ms delay before the window appears , but then all successive API calls ( whether .ping ( ) or otherwise ) no longer block the UI . We 're getting to the verge of callback hell , but this is n't too bad.So ... this is a request-promise issue ( which is asynchronous , as far as I can tell from the docs ) . Not sure why this behavior is only showing-up on the first call , so please feel free to let me know if you know ! Otherwise , the little hacky bit will have to do for now . ( Note : I 'm the only person who will ever use this desktop app , so I 'm not too worried about displaying a `` ping failed '' message . For a commercial release , I would alert the user to a failed API call . )"

"I am a bit confused as to when I should use the attrs constructor to pass props in styled-components : and when I should just pass them direcly : I understand that the first method is changing the in-line style and the second is generating a class but I 'm unsure of the implications of these differences . I have seen an error in the console that says `` Over 200 classes were generated for component styled.div .

"Given a HTML Element object , is it possible to add the same style property twice to it without having to resort to string manipulation ?

"I 'm taking my first steps into web components without using any third-party libraries , such as Polymer . One of the main selling points is that web component styles are separated from styles defined elsewhere , allowing the component 's shadow-DOM to be styled in a sandbox-like environment.The issue I 'm running into is how styles cascade through slotted elements . Since slotted elements are not part of the shadow DOM , they can only be targed with the : :slotted ( ) selector within the component template . This is great , but it makes it almost impossible to guarantee a web component will display correctly in all contexts , since externally-defined styles also apply with undefeatable specificity* to slotted elements . *besides ! important.This issue can be distilled down to this : I 'm having a hard time understanding the value of this `` feature '' .

"I have an asynchronous queue worker running as a Tornado script on my server -- it hosts a subclass of Tornado 's PeriodicTask , which consumes events from Redis . To monitor the queue , I set up a tornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler subclass on a URL , and then encapsulated the client WebSocket JavaScript in a jQuery plugin ( here is the full code ) .The idea is , you can have a number of queues on the server , and so you can use the jQuery module to set up a widget that specifically monitors that queue . At the moment , the logic is dead simple -- the widgets merely indicate how many tasks are enqueued in their target queue.Here 's the init code in question : The javascript uses window.setInterval ( ) to periodically send a message to the socket ; the server replies with the status of the queue for which it was asked , and the socket 's frontend callback updates the DOM.But the problem is : after a few minutes of this sort of polling -- set off specifically by navigating between pages containing the client socket code -- the sockets fail by throwing an exception with a message like DOM_ERROR_11 and a message that the socket object is no longer valid.Once the page enters this error condition , I have to restart both the browser and the server websocket script to get everything to start up again ... .

"I am trying to process an insert event from the CKEditor 5.When typing in the editor the call back is called . The data argument in the event callback looks like approximately like this : I do n't see a convenient way to figure out what text was actually inserted . I can call data.range.root.getNodeByPath ( data.range.start.path ) ; which seems to get me the text node that the text was inserted in . Should we then look at the text node 's data field ? Should we assume that the last item in the path is always an offset for the start and end of the range and use that to substring ? I think the insert event is also fired for inserting non-text type things ( e.g . element ) . How would we know that this is indeed a text type of an event ? Is there something I am missing , or is there just a different way to do this all together ?"

"Is it possible to execute a block of code without the implicit with ( global ) context that all scripts seem to have by default ? For example , in a browser , would there be any way to set up a script so that a line such asthrows Uncaught ReferenceError : location is not definedinstead of accessing window.location , when location has not been declared first ? Lacking that , is there a way that such an implicit reference could result in a warning of some sort ? It can be a source of bugs when writing code ( see below ) , so having a way to guard against it could be useful . ( Of course , due to ordinary scoping rules , it 's possible to declare another variable with the same name using const or let , or within an inner block , to ensure that using that variable name references the new variable rather than the global property , but that 's not the same thing . ) This may be similar to asking whether it 's possible to stop referencing a property from within an actual with statement : It 's known that with should not be used in the first place , but unfortunately it seems we have no choice when it comes to the with ( global ) , which occasionally saves a few characters at the expense of confusing bugs which pop up somewhat frequently : 1 2 3 4 5 6 . For example : ( the issue here : window.status is a reserved property - when assigned to , it coerces the assigned expression to a string ) These sorts of bugs are the same reason that explicit use of with is discouraged or prohibited , yet the implicit with ( global ) continues to cause issues , even in strict mode , so figuring out a way around it would be useful ."

"Currently I use Vuetify for base components and would like to create reusable extensions . For example a list containing checkboxes , a datatable column with some functionality etc.For this question I will take the list containing checkboxes example . I created the following component called CheckboxGroup.vueThis component takes an array of objects as a property and creates a checkbox for each entry.Important parts are v-model= '' item.state '' and : label= '' item.title '' . Most of the time the state attribute will have a different name , same for the title attribute.For testing purposes I created a view file called Home.vue holding an array of documents.This time title is called name and state is called deleted . Obviously CheckboxGroup is not able to manage the documents because the attribute names are wrong.How would you solve this problem ? Would you create a computed property and rename these attributes ? Would be a bad idea I think ... And by the way , is using v-model a good idea ? A different solution would be to listen to the changed event of a checkbox and emit an event with the item index . Then you would have to listen for the change in the parent component.I do n't think there is a way to create something likebecause it would be bad design anyway . I hope that this is a very trivial problem and every Vue developer has been confronted with it , since the primary goal should always be to develop abstract components that can be reused multiple times.Please keep in mind that this checkbox problem is just an example . A solution for this problem would also solve same or similar problems : )"

Then , if you mouseover one of the magnifying glasses in your result set , a number of things happen.the mousover event for the magnifying glass firesthis calls an ( as of yet ) unknown function with unknown parametersthe function makes a cross-site call to google 's image results query serverthose results are stored in google 's VS class memory ` google.vs.ha ` I 've copied the code from google 's library and run it through an un-minifier so it 's slightly more readable . I 've also installed breakpoints in the code through firebug so I can inspect the dom & memory space before during and after I load the page.My end goal is to be able to replicate the mousover event in code by calling the same function that is called - but - I 'm stuck in trying to find the right function . ( i 'm sure it involves google.vs.Ga ( a , b , c ) but I 'm just not quite there yet.I know this is pretty much the craziest obsession ever - but - I dunno . Maybe if you 're also reading stack on a Sunday you understand : ) What function is being called `` On Hover '' that sends out the command to get the image requests ? EDIT : There are a few upvotes on this so far tho I thought I 'd add a bit more background to anyone wanting to catch up in firebug , you can follow what 's happening in javascript at any time.Is a picture of what google looks like `` in memory '' you can look at all of the functions and calls and the current state of variables.You can also actually access and call those variables by putting links in your bookmarks bar . for example javascript : alert ( google.base_href ) after a search will tell you the URL you 're at ... and it gets way more exciting from there.EDIT NUMER 2 : a huge thanks to Matt who managed to crack this in one go : )"

"We have a problem that is only evident on iOS browsers ( iOS 12.0 ) with our SPA application that uses HTML object tags to load widgets ( HTML/CSS/JS files ) through JavaScript onto the page . The issue is an intermittent one when the page is loaded some of the widgets do n't display/render on the screen , yet are loaded into the DOM and can be viewed/highlighted with full element properties in the Safari Web Inspector . but are “ invisible ” to their user . The problem will occur about 50 % of the time if there are 4 widgets to load on a page , 2 typically wo n't display and it will be different widgets not displaying each time , with no detectable pattern.The widget javascript load events run properly and there are no errors in the console . In the Safari Web Inspector , we can see some of the HTML elements from the non-rendering object are loaded at position 0,0 but their style is correct in the DOM ( left and top set correctly , display : inline , etc . ) .Here is the code that loads the widgets ( the fragment is added to the DOM after all widgets are setup ) : Here is the code in the load event that configures the widget once loaded ( we work around a Chrome bug that also affects Safari where the load event is fired twice for every object loaded ) : The code performs correctly in Chrome ( Mac/Windows ) , IE and Safari ( Mac ) , however , presents the random invisible loading issue in iOS Safari and also in iOS Chrome .

"I know this question has been asked before , but none of the answers seem to resolve the issue . I 'm testing an AJAX webpage which updates elements in the DOM via javascript . Every minute , the server is queried for new data and the DOM is updated accordingly . From what I can tell , the memory usage for this page in Chrome grows , but not too much ( it starts around 40 MB and reaches maybe 80 MB max ) . In Firefox , however , the memory usage starts around 120 MB and can expand to over 400 MB .

"React 16 triggers componentDidMount ( ) when going back in Safari , even tho the component never unmounted . How does react know when to mount ? BackgroundSafari uses bfcache . If you go back it takes the last page from cache.When using react 15.3 or libraries such as preact , leaving the page will not trigger componentWillUnmount and going back will not trigger componentDidMount.This behaviour causes several issues - for example when you set your page state to loading before redirecting . If the user goes back , the state is still set to loading and you can not even reset the state using componentDidMount , because it never triggers.There is a solution , by using onpageshow , but since it only triggers one time , you have to reload the whole page using window.location.reload ( ) . This is also the reason react can not rely on this solution ."

I created a REST api and want to validate the body and the params before calling the controller logic .

To reproduce the error create the app.js fileDue to the fact each validation fails there is only one route required to test it . Create users.js with the following contentAnd this users.js controller fileWhen it comes to the policy I created the users.js policy which adds the required schema to the middlewareand then the schema gets validated by my schemaValidation.jsAs you can see I pass in the whole req object . I do this because sometimes I have to validate the body and the params . The url parameter userId is not found by Joi so I get returned a status code of 400 . How can I fix my middleware validation to validate both objects within the req object ?

"This is an example of a fee calculator that will run a live tally of fees ( jQuery ) based on what the user selects and answers .

Like the examples below and snippet below.For example ( three scenarios ) : [ 1 ] if 4-12 months from now is chosen , as well as 2dr vehicle with a weight under 2499 the price will be 28.10 added to the running fee calculator . [ 2 ] if 4-12 months from now is chosen , as well as 2dr vehicle with a weight between 2500 and 3499 the price will be 36.10 added to the running fee calculator .

"In the below code we are passing an object . So , according to javascript we are passing a reference and manipulating.But 10 is alerted instead of 12 . Why ?"
"I 'm sure that this is relatively straightforward and that I 'm missing something obvious . I 'm reading through Mozilla 's tutorials on ES6 , and their chapter on destructuring contains the following pattern : FUNCTION PARAMETER DEFINITIONS As developers , we can often expose more ergonomic APIs by accepting a single object with multiple properties as a parameter instead of forcing our API consumers to remember the order of many individual parameters . We can use destructuring to avoid repeating this single parameter object whenever we want to reference one of its properties : This is a simplified snippet of real world code from the Firefox DevTools JavaScript debugger ( which is also implemented in JavaScript—yo dawg ) . We have found this pattern particularly pleasing.What I do n't understand is how this relates to destructuring . Is the idea that you permit the ability to pass an object into this function that can be in arbitrary order as long as it contains all items , i.e . { line : 10 , column : 20 , url : 'localhost ' } ? If so , what is the benefit over something like where params is an object with url , line , and column ? Is the idea just that you force Javascript to validate a function 's parameters when used in a destructured context by explicitly defining them ?"

"I 'm trying to stop a particular click event from bubbling to document-root , which in result closes one of my popup . I need to stop bubbling of the event and body or html are my only options to intercept and stop it.The date-picker popup is generated on the fly so I can not use a direct event on .ui-icon element , so I have registered a delegate event on body element to stop it from bubbling.Surprisingly enough registering a direct event to body element and checking the event 's target works just fine.I am really at a loss , why the previous one does not work where the later does , both of them are supposed to do the same .

"UP-FRONT NOTE : I am not using jQuery or another library here because I want to understand what I ’ ve written and why it works ( or doesn ’ t ) , so please don ’ t answer this with libraries or plugins for libraries . I have nothing against libraries , but for this project they ’ re inimical to my programming goals.That said…Over at http : //meyerweb.com/eric/css/colors/ I added some column sorting using DOM functions I wrote myself . The problem is that while it works great for , say , the simple case of alphabetizing strings , the results are inconsistent across browsers when I try to sort on multiple numeric terms—in effect , when I try to do a sort with two subsorts.For example , if you click “ Decimal RGB ” a few times in Safari or Firefox on OS X , you get the results I intended . Do the same in Chrome or Opera ( again , OS X ) and you get very different results . Yes , Safari and Chrome diverge here.Here ’ s a snippet of the JS I ’ m using for the RGB sort : ( sorter being the array I ’ m trying to sort . ) The sort is done in the tradition of another StackOverflow question “ How does one sort a multi dimensional array by multiple columns in JavaScript ? ” and its top answer . Yet the results are not what I expected in two of the four browsers I initially tried out.I sort ( ha ! ) of get that this has to do with array sorts being “ unstable ” —no argument here ! —but what I don ’ t know is how to overcome it in a consistent , reliable manner . I could really use some help both understanding the problem and seeing the solution , or at least a generic description of the solution.I realize there are probably six million ways to optimize the rest of the JS ( yes , I used a global ) .

Then setInterval calls increase after a delay of 1 second .

"Inside a long text document there are some `` special words '' to which I want to display notes/annotations on the left . Each note should be as close as possible to the level of the word it is refering to.The HTML for this is organised in a table . Each paragraph is one table row , consisting on annotations in the left and main text in the right table column . the notes/annotations go to the left . However , unfortunately , there are also some other elements/text nodes in there.It 's easy to change the `` note '' -spans to absolute and positioned them on the level of their reference : However , life is not so simple here . Since there could be a lot of reference words in one line ( while on other there are none of them ) I need a rather sophisticated way to distribute the notes so that they are as close as possible to their references without destroying anything in the layout ( e.g . being placed outside of the table cell or overlapping with other elements ) .Furthermore , the height of the table cells could not be changed . Elements which are not notes must not be moved . ( Note elements are always in the order they appear in the main text . That 's not the problem . ) So , I need an algorithm like this : Take all notes in a table cell.Analyse blank space in that table cell : Which areas are blank , which are blocked ? Distribute the notes in the table cell so that each note is as close as possible to its reference word without any element colliding with any other item in the table cell.Is there any fast and elegant way to do this without having to write hundreds of lines of code ? Here is a JSfiddle : https : //jsfiddle.net/5vLsrLa7/7/ [ Update on suggested solutions ] Simply setting the position of the side notes to relative or just moving notes down wo n't work , because in this case , the side notes will just go downwards relative to their desired position which results in side notes way to far from their reference words . After all , for a neat solution I need to side notes spread in both directions : up and down . [ Update ] The expected result would be something like this : As you see , it 's never possible to place all the notes at the height of their reference . However , the free space is used to position them as close as possible , moving them up and down ."

"This has become more of a pondering about how javascript works , than an actual problem to fix . In the case of a statement like The resultant str var would contain the value `` 9 some words here '' . My question is what function does javascript use to automatically coerce the Number object ' 9 ' into a string to be concatenated with the String object `` some words here '' , and is this function changeable/overrideable.This started from me needing to output single digits with a preceding 0 on a page . This was easy enough to accomplish with a quick prototype function on the Number objectAnd call it with a simple ( 9 ) .SpecialFormat ( ) + `` words here '' ; But that got me wondering if I could overwrite the toString function on a Number with a , and just let javascripts automatic conversion handle it for me , so I could use a standard 9 + `` words here '' ; to get the same result `` 09 words here '' . This did not just implicitly work , I had to end up adding .toString to the 9 ( 9 ) .toString ( ) + `` words here '' ( which upon taking a further look , would have resulted in some infinite loops ) . So is there a way to override the built in functionality of a javascript native type ? *Note : I realize this is likely a 'worst idea ever '"

"I want to create an RxJS observable stream from Google Map events .

"I was wondering what is best practice or at least a practice for using Jasmine to test javascript that requires remote libraries called on page load , but not in the app.More specifically , I 'm creating a backbone view for processing payments using stripe .

But my tests do n't have my layout , so when I try to do thisIt gives the error.I 'd rather not depend on remote libraries for my test , nor do I really want to go against stripe preferred method of relying on their source code .

"I 'm just curious to know how jQuery is able to hijack the 'this ' keyword in Javascript . From the book I 'm reading : `` Javascript the Definitive Guide '' it states that `` this '' is a keyword and you can not alter it like you can with an identifier . Now , say you are in your own object constructor and you make a call to some jQuery code , how is it able to hijack this from you ? My only guess would be that since you are providing a callback to the jQuery each ( ) function , you are now working with a closure that has the jQuery scope chain , and not your own object 's scope chain . Is this on the right track ? thanks"

"I looked around internet and was always looking like from previous 6 months for a script that could load flash content/game while showing an actual loading screen But I always received a few answers : It is not possible to show an actual loading with Javascript.You can do it only by adding action script to the flash file maybe they are talking about FLAWhy Do n't you show a fake loading screen that appears and show someseconds and then disappears ( the most annoying this of such screenis that they first make user load 15 seconds then the flash startsloading , if it starts loading those 15 seconds still it is worthsomething it is good BUT making them wait double is really bad ) But at last I found something that I was looking forever . A Jquery based script that shows actual loading ( shows ad too ) and uses swf Object to talk to flash content too . It is really awesome as it does n't require you to do changes to the FLA , it is just pure outer environment dealing . So now the question arises what 's the issue then . Well the issue is that this script was made for pixels , it works if you are using width and height for flash in pixels , while I ca n't use pixels as I am using % ages ( this way user have ability to go full screen optionally by pressing f11 ) .So as you can see I want that script to work with % ages that is my problem , but as I mentioned earlier I did n't came here right away I have been asking for help ( Actually Begging ) in over 14 forums from previous few months and of course some good people still exists some people helped me to reach a certain point ( but it did n't solve the problem ) So now I will provide some Markup : Here is link to the script that I am talking about http : //www.balloontowerdefense.net/jquery-preloader/jquery-preloader.html ( It is the link to the creator of this script ) Here is a link to working example ( flash based on Pixels ) http : //www.balloontowerdefense.net/jquery-preloader/example.html Some one helped me here but it did n't work 1 month ago . The person told me that I should change the plugin Named as Preroll the changes preferred were theseModify the plugin to use user-supplied units instead of pixels . To do this , you will need to modify two functions in the plugin , applygameiframe and showgame.Once those changes are made , the inline CSS should be set to whatever you supply as parameters ( i.e. , 100 % , 50em , etc . ) .I did the changes told to be done as described above to the Preroll plugin and after that this is what I get http : //files.cryoffalcon.com/MyFootPrint/fullscreen.htmlNow if you let the game load ( as loading screen appears ) all is well done except that in the end , the game does n't appear , it loads but when it should skip and make the game appear at that time something goes wrong . ( For reference you can see this link http : //www.balloontowerdefense.net/jquery-preloader/example.html here when the loading finishes then game appears ) Can Someone Fix this problem ?

BackgroundI am trying to integrate Videos into a slide show presentation app . I have disabled the controls on the students side and have a play/pause button wired up to the YouTube API so that when it is clicked an event is triggered through pusher and the Video starts on the teachers screen and the Students screen.DifficultiesThe problem comes when one of the users has a slow internet connection . If The teacher has faster internet than the student then the videos will be out of sync.My ApproachI have a function which uses the YouTube API to control the playing and pausing of a video . Inside the video object I have added an onStateChange event listener that is triggered when a video is playing/paused/buffering . The event is sent to this function.So when the teachers presses play the video starts and truggers a play event which gets sent to the above function . This function sends a pusher event to the students browser with a status of 1 which means play the video . This event is received by this function : My understandingTeacher presses play buttontogglePlay ( ) is calledthis.isPlaying = false so playVideo ( ) is calledvideo starts playing for teacherThe YouTube api then triggers an onStateChange eventthis is sent to the emittStateChange ( ) function with status 1 ( playing ) This status is sent via pusher to the students receiveStateChange ( ) functionfor case = 1 this.isPlaying ( ) is set to falsetoggle play is called to start the students videoStudents video starts buffering which triggers the youtube api onStateChange event againStatus 3 ( buffering ) is then sent back to the teacher via pusherThis pauses the teachers video to wait for the studentProblem : When the teachers video stops the onStateChange event is triggered yetagain before the students video is done buffering and sent to the student . This stops the students video and now both videos are paused.What I want : When the students video is buffering I just want to temporarily pause the teachers video UNTIL the students is playing then play both . I just do n't understand how I should break this cycle that ends in both videos being paused .

I want to be able to do something like this in my app : Where pill-autocomplete has a template that transcludes into a child directive like this : It does n't seem possible given that ng-transclude creates scope and the < pills > directive has an isolate scope.One way I have thought of accomplishing this is by injecting the pill template inside the autocomplete 's template function .

I 'd also have to do this in every directive that has similar behavior with pills.Is there any other way to accomplish this in angular 1.x ?

"Whenever a non-integer pixel value is used for the border of an element , the browser simply truncates the value to become an integer . Why is this the case ? I 'm aware that the border will not actually take up part of a pixel , but these types of values are sometimes used in combination with others to form full pixels . For example , the left and right border having widths of 1.6px should cause the total width of the element to increase by 3px . This works because the full value is stored in memory and used for calculations.However , this seems to not be the case when rendering the border even though width , padding , and margin all behave correctly.When tested , the code produced the same results ( disregarding exact precision ) consistently . Most major browsers ( Chrome , Firefox , Opera ) behaved the same . The exceptions were Safari 5.1 ( which rendered padding and margin similar to border , but this is probably just due to the version ) and Internet Explorer ( which calculated the border-top-width correctly ) .Width , padding , and margin all were remembered as decimal values and allowed for padding to affect height accordingly , but border was not . It was truncated to an integer . Why is this specifically only the case width border ? Would there be any way to make the border value be remembered in a fuller form so that the true height of the element could be retrieved using JavaScript ?"
"I have a problem with Highcharts libraries . I have created various charts with the Custom Visualization tool available in Jaspersoft Studio . They do not use all the same library , e.g .

But when I create a Dashboard containing two differents reports , I have this error : Uncaught Highcharts error # 16 : www.highcharts.com/errors/16 Highcharts already defined in the pageThis error happens the second time Highcharts or Highstock is loaded in the same page , so the Highcharts namespace is already defined . Keep in mind that the Highcharts.Chart constructor and all features of Highcharts are included in Highstock , so if you are running Chart and StockChart in combination , you only need to load the highstock.js file.I do understand that there is a conflict between Highmaps.js and Highstock.js as they have features in common . But I do not know how to avoid it : I need features from both Highmaps and Highstocks .

Basically I want to achieve equivalent of doing : and then as described here this works fine when using mogo client , but within Meteor I have so far only gotten to the point of understanding that I would most likely need to use connection string below ( or something similar ) but question remains - how to pass certificates to the connection ? Update : there is answer that deals with the issue using native noddejs mongo driver . question is - how to port this to Meteor . Update 2015-12-31 : I have accepted the answer that points to using different connection object when defining the Collection . It is a hassle to do it for each collection separately , but it seems to be the only way this is doable right now . Also , if need arises , probably some MySslCollection can be created , that others can use to inherit connection details . This has not been tested ."

"Consider this example of pretty standard method in Angular Js , which updates the view : This is of course hypothetical example , but it nicely shows pattern , which could be described as reusing of local variables from within AJAX callbacks.Of course in both handlers ( success and error ) we are creating a closure over hugeData which is directly referenced from callback handlers.My question is : since the result of AJAX call can be only either success or failure , will reusing of this code cause the memory leak over time ?

"I am experimenting few best practices in AngularJS specially on designing model . One true power in my opinion in AngularJS is 'When model changes view gets updated & vice versa ' . That leads to the obvious fact 'At any given time the model is the single source of truth for application state'Now , After reading various blog posts on designing the right model structure and I decided to use something like 'Single Object ' approach . Meaning the whole app state is maintained in a single JavaScript object.For example of a to-do application } ; This object will go HUGE depending on the application complexity . Regarding this I have the below worries and marked them as questions . Is such approach advisable ? What are the downsides and pitfalls I will face when application starts to scale ? When small portion of object is updated say priority is increased will angular smartly re-render the delta alone or will it consider the object got changed and re-render whole screen ? ( This will lead to poor performance ) , If so what are the works around ? Now since the whole DOM got smoothly translated into one JavaScript object the application has to keep manipulating this object . Do we have right tools for complex JavaScript object manipulation like jQuery was king of DOM manipulator ? With the above doubts I strongly find the below advantages.Data has got neatly abstracted & well organized so that anytime itcan be serialized to server , firebase or local export to user . Implementing crash recovery will be easy , Think this feature as 'Hibernate ' option in desktops.Model & View totally decoupled . For example , company A can write Model to maintain state and few obvious Controllers to change themodel and some basic view to interact with users . Now this company Acan invite other developer to openly write their own views andrequesting the company A for more controllers and REST methods . Thiswill empower LEAN development . What if I start versioning this object to server and I can make a playback to the user in the SAME way he saw the website and can continue to work without hassle . This will work as a true back button for single page apps ."

"I 've got a custom draggable element ( the drag starts on click and ends on click ) , which could be dropped on some areas . On mouseover area decides whether it accepts current draggable or not , and changes its color respectively . Everything worked like a charm until client decides that draggable element should be positioned above and to the left of cursor , and that 's where the story starts.When I moved it , I realized that mouseover event now goes to the draggable , not the area . I did some search and found magic CSS property . Which unfortunately does n't work in IE9 , and it is our target browser.Here 's a simple example of what it looks like : http : //jsfiddle.net/q9njK/5/ The question is : can I get it working in IE9 in a simpler way than directly watching mousemove and calculating which area is pointer over now ?

"I 've assembled a modestly sized application and I am in the process of factoring code to reduce the overall number of maintained lines , as well as performance tuning . The use case that has me posting this question is that I have a button embedded in a menu that invokes ( or needs to invoke ) a method on a controller that displays a form . This currently is implemented using a direct reference to the specific button control , creating a panel , and putting that panel inside of my viewport.The question at : ExtJS 4.1 Call One Controller From Another begins to address the issue of best-practices near the end of responses , but does n't really settle on a base-case that can be reproduced or extended to cover more complex implementations ( which is the aim of my question . ) Given the two controllers : A `` main menu '' controller.A user account controllerThe QuestionWhat would be the ( best ) way to implement a crosswise connection between the two controllers to properly delegate the responsibility of responding to a click event on the menu button for `` Create a New Account ? `` One Possible SolutionUsing componentquery I can easily narrow down the focus of the button in the main menu view using a tag property such that the User controller is responding directly to the event : An unknown alternativeOr I could possible winnow my way through the object graph to find the reference to the User controller from the Menu controller and invoke it that way.The real questionThe question that results from all of this is what the `` most acceptable '' solution is here . One could imagine the use of a third , mediating controller , to `` route '' requests from controls to controllers but I think that goes against what the remainder of the framework is attempting to do . Using a variation of either of these methods currently works however neither feels completely clean and reliable ; or ultimately maintainable long-term ( as code gets spread out rather quickly . ) Additionally the thought had occurred to us to drop into raw events but we run into the same kind of maintainability issues there.Thanks !"

"EditI 'm essentially trying to create the Mario style jump , so as you touch / mousedown on the body I have an object that starts travelling up , but when you let go this acceleration stops . This means I ca n't use FastClick as I 'm looking for touchstart , touchend events , not a single click event.~I 'm trying to respond to a touchstart event on mobile in browser . At the moment I 'm using these two listeners : I 'm essentially trying to emulate something I 've had working really well where I use keydown and keyup events to make a box jump and fall respectively.The issue I 'm having is that a touch start , if you do n't swipe , is actually delaying for a short while .

"What I want to achieve is to detect the precise time of when a certain change appeared on the screen ( primarily with Google Chrome ) . For example I show an item using $ ( `` xelement '' ) .show ( ) ; or change it using $ ( `` # xelement '' ) .text ( `` sth new '' ) ; and then I would want to see what the performance.now ( ) was exactly when the change appeared on the user 's screen with the given screen repaint . So I 'm totally open to any solutions - below I just refer primarily to requestAnimationFrame ( rAF ) because that is the function that is supposed to help achieve exactly this , only it does n't seem to ; see below.Basically , as I imagine , rAF should execute everything inside it in about 0-17 ms ( whenever the next frame appears on my standard 60 Hz screen ) . Moreover , the timestamp argument should give the value of the time of this execution ( and this value is based on the same DOMHighResTimeStamp measure as performance.now ( ) ) .Now here is one of the many tests I made for this : https : //jsfiddle.net/gasparl/k5nx7zvh/31/What I see in Chrome is : the function inside rAF is executed always within about 0-3 ms ( counting from a performance.now ( ) immediately before it ) , and , what 's weirdest , the rAF timestamp is something totally different from what I get with the performance.now ( ) inside the rAF , being usually about 0-17 ms earlier than the performance.now ( ) called before the rAF ( but sometimes about 0-1 ms afterwards ) .Here is a typical example : In Firefox and in IE it is different . In Firefox the `` before vs. RAF callback start '' is either around 1-3 ms or around 16-17 ms . The `` before vs. RAF stamp '' is always positive , usually around 0-3 ms , but sometimes anything between 3-17 ms . In IE both differences are almost always around 15-18 ms ( positive ) . These are more or less the same of different PCs . However , when I run it on my phone 's Chrome , then , and only then , it seems plausibly correct : `` before vs. RAF stamp '' randomly around 0-17 , and `` RAF callback start '' always a few ms afterwards.For more context : This is for an online response-time experiment where users use their own PC ( but I typically restrict browser to Chrome , so that 's the only browser that really matters to me ) . I show various items repeatedly , and measure the response time as `` from the moment of the display of the element ( when the person sees it ) to the moment when they press a key '' , and count an average from the recorded response times for specific items , and then check the difference between certain item types . This also means that it does n't matter much if the recorded time is always a bit skewed in a direction ( e.g . always 3 ms before the actual appearance of the element ) as long as this skew is consistent for each display , because only the difference really matters . A 1-2 ms precision would be the ideal , but anything that mitigates the random `` refresh rate noise '' ( 0-17 ms ) would be nice.I also gave a try to jQuery.show ( ) callback , but it does not take refresh rate into account : https : //jsfiddle.net/gasparl/k5nx7zvh/67/With HTML : The solution ( based on Kaiido 's answer ) along with working display example :"

"I have been reading and testing below code out for several hours now and I just ca n't seem to grasp certain things.I have been stepping through chrome console basically putting break in every line I can add and have been inspecting and I am just not sure of things1 ) I am just not sure of the purpose of deps array .

How can I programmatically detect if an object is a jQuery object ? For example :
"Some code that I do n't have control over is overriding the global JSON object without checking if it 's already implemented : The problem is that this version of the JSON parser is very old and has a bug , which is fouling up my attempts at serialization . ( Others have had a similar problem with this implementation . ) Can I get at the browser 's native implementation ? I thought delete would work , but it does n't .

"I 'm trying to implement something like this : Now that 's obivously uncompilable nonsense , since we try to sample a before creating it , but hopefully it makes my intent clear : Every emitted value from a should depend on one of the old values previously emitted by a . Which old value of a , that 's decided by when was the last time that c emitted something . It 's kinda like calling pairwise on a , except that I do n't want the last two values , but the latest and another from further back.Note that if not for the startWith ( aInitial ) bits , this would n't even be a well-defined question , since the first value emitted by a would be defined cyclically , refering to itself . However , as long as the first value a is specified separately , the construction makes mathematical sense . I just do n't know how to implement it in code in a clean way . My hunch is that there would be a long-winded way of doing this by writing a custom Subject of some kind , but something more elegant would be very welcome.To make this a bit more concrete , in my use case I 'm dealing with a click-and-drag-to-pan type of UI element . m is an Observable of mousemove events , c is an Observable of mousedown events . a would then be something that keeps changing based where the cursor is , and what the value of a was when the click-down happened ."
"I need to manually construct/fire a mousedown event in a way that can be handled by any relevant event handlers ( either in straight JS , jQuery , or interact.js ) , just as a natural mousedown event would . However , the event does not seem to trigger anything the way I expect it to.I am trying to make some irregularly shaped images draggable using the interact.js library . The images are simply rectangular img elements with transparent portions . On each element , I have defined 2 interact.js event listeners : Checking if the click was inside the image area , disabling drag if not ( fires on `` down '' event ) Handling the drag ( fires on `` drag '' event ) However , if the img elements are overlapping , and the user clicks in the transparent area of the top element but on the filled area of the lower element , the lower element should be the target of the drag . After trying several things ( see below ) , I have settled on the solution of : re-ordering the z-indexes of the elements at the same time that I disable drag in step 1 , then re-firing the mousedown event on all lower elements . I 'm using the `` native '' event type ( not jQuery or interact.js ) in hopes that it will literally just replicate the original mousedown event.Unfortunately , this does not work , as the mousedown event does not register with any of the handlers . Why ? I have all the ( relevant ) code at this JSFiddle : https : //jsfiddle.net/tfollo/xr27938a/10/Note that this JSFiddle does not seem to work as smoothly as it does in a normal browser window , but I think it demonstrates the intended functionality.Other things I have tried : Lots of people have proposed different schemes to handle similar problems ( i.e . forwarding events to lower layers , using pointer-events : none , etc ) , but none seem to work to trigger the interact.js handler and start a drag interaction on the right element . I also tried using interaction.start ( provided by interact.js ) but it seems buggy -- there is at least one open issue on the topic and when I tried to start a new drag interaction on a target of my choice I got lots of errors from within the library 's code.I 'm not against revisiting any of these solutions per se , but I would also really like to know why manually firing a mousedown event wo n't work ."

I am relatively new to Backbone and I am running into this problem.I am using Backbone with DustJSMy template looks something like this - index.dustThis is my partial below - responseMessage.dustMy JS looks like thisBelow function is called when an event occurs and it does a POST and returns successfully.My implementations of the callback functionthis.model belongs to the model of the whole page . Whereas this.responseMessageView.model is the model for the partial . Question : This works perfectly fine in most of the cases . There is one case where it does not render the partial with the latest model values . When I click on the button on index.dust and primaryViewSuccess is executed . After which I click on another button and trigger responseViewEventTrigger . It does the POST successfully and it comes to responseViewSuccess and stores it in the model too . But it does not show it on the frontend . data.success is still not true whereas console.log ( this.responseMessageView.model ) show that attributes- > data- > success = trueBut the same behavior when I refresh the page it all works perfect . Its just that when primaryViewSuccess is called and then responseViewSuccess its not taking the latest model changes . In other words model is being updated but the DOM remains the same.What am I missing here ? Thanks for your time !

However , the same html form validation that worked before ( when using a 'submit ' button ) , no longer shows a hint and the form sends regardless of whether there is input or not.I have read that because I am calling the form.submit ( ) programmatically , it bypasses the onSubmit ( ) function of a form , which is where the validation takes place.My question is : Can I programmatically force the onSubmit ( ) so that I get the validation pop up ? I must make clear that I am NOT wanting to create a JavaScript form validation , i.e . using an alert ; rather , use JavaScript to enforce the HTML validation as found here , when you click submit : https : //jsfiddle.net/qdzxfm9u/"
"This article hit the top of HackerNews recently : http : //highscalability.com/blog/2013/9/18/if-youre-programming-a-cell-phone-like-a-server-youre-doing.html # In which it states : The cell radio is one of the biggest battery drains on a phone . Every time you send data , no matter how small , the radio is powered on for up for 20-30 seconds . Every decision you make should be based on minimizing the number of times the radio powers up . Battery life can be dramatically improved by changing the way your apps handle data transfers . Users want their data now , the trick is balancing user experience with transferring data and minimizing power usage . A balance is achieved by apps carefully bundling all repeating and intermittent transfers together and then aggressively prefetching the intermittent transfers.I would like to modify $ .ajax to add an option like `` does n't need to be done right now , just do this request when another request is launched '' . What would be a good way to go about this ? I started with this : I ca n't tell by the wording of the paper , I guess a good batch `` interval '' is 2-5 minutes , so I just used 5.Is this a good implementation ? How can I make this a true modification of just the ajax method , by adding a { batchable : true } option to the method ? I have n't quite figured that out either.Does setInterval also keep the phone awake all the time ? Is that a bad thing to do ? Is there a better way to not do that ? Are there other things here that would cause a battery to drain faster ? Is this kind of approach even worthwhile ? There are so many things going on at once in a modern smartphone , that if my app is n't using the cell , surely some other app is . Javascript ca n't detect if the cell is on or not , so why bother ? Is it worth bothering ?"

"For the full story , check out my other question.Basically , I had asked if it were more efficient to use named functions in the socket handlers for the following code : The overall answer was yes ( see the above link for more details ) , but the following comment was posted by ThiefMaster : I 'm not familiar with V8 internals but it might be smart enough to compile the function once and re-use it everytime , just with a different scope attached.So now that 's my question . Is V8 smart enough to compile anonymous functions once and reuse them with different scopes in situations where anonymous functions ordinarily lead to several function instances being created ? For example , above I would expect the handler for the connection event to be created once but the handlers for action1 , action2 , and disconnect to be created for each connection . In the other question this was solved with named functions but I am more interested if this is necessary in V8 or if it will do some optimizations ."

"So , I was thinking how arrays are stored in memory in JavaScript.I already read How are JavaScript arrays represented in physical memory ? , but I could n't find my answer.What I 'm thinking is more about the memory location of the array units . In C for example , you need to define the size of the array when you define them . With this , C defines a whole block of memory , and it can look the exact location of each unit.For example : In JS , you can grow the size of an array after allocating memory to other stuff , which means JS does n't work with the `` block '' type of array.But if arrays are not a single block of memory , how does JS calculate where each unit is ? Do JS arrays follows a linked list type of structure ?"

"In backbone I can use my models in different ways.As I understand , a ( Data ) model is used to store data ( possibly served from a RESTful web server ) and a ViewModel is used to store information about a specific view ( The views hidden/shown state for example ) .Most of my knowledge is from this SO question.After reading this article where the author says : Render UI Upon Data Change , Not User Interactionand The flow is : User interaction - > data change - > view render . For instance , if we are writing a play/pause toggle button in an audio player , the flow would be : The user hits ‘ play ’ The model ( data ) state changes to ‘ playing ’ The view renders in ‘ playing ’ mode Following this pattern ensures that changes to the state triggered from other sources ( such as fast forward , new playlist , network error , etc . ) will toggle our button to do the right thing . In other words , we have a single source of truth : whenever our model changes we know we should render our button.I started to wonder the advantages and disadvantages of using each one.Assuming we only have one model per view ( I know we could have more , but if we limit it to one ) .I can think of , ViewModel pros : The ones mentioned in the article.Information about a view is saved in a model , preventing the view being cluttered.State information can be shared between views.cons : Can not call Backbone 's save ( ) method because this will cause the model to save incorrect data to the server ( the views state for example ) . Can not call Backbone 's fetch ( ) method easily because we might trample our views data . ( Data ) Model pros : Use backbone 's built in save , fetch etc.views can share data without worrying about view specific data being stored in them.cons : Models can only be used for dataAm I correct in thinking this ? Should I have a model for my data and a model for my view ? How does this work with collections ? I know Backbone is very loose and there are no hard and fast rules.But , does anybody have any real world experience of using one or the other ? Or possibly both ? Any help is appreciated ."

"I 'm building upon the experience with a previous large scale angular 2 app . I 've been really careful to keep the rendering cycles under control . Keeping a log is how I investigate what happens.ControllerTemplateI 've been using only ngrx state store subscriptions in the smart components . This way I can avoid completely the need of using ActivatedRouteSnapshot or RouteReuseStrategyGuardSmart component with ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPushUsing ng serve -- prod -- aot I 've been able to see that the rendering of parent components is executed onlz once if I use guards instead of resolvers . Using resolvers leads to multiple renderings to get the same initial state . In the Angular documentation guards are recommended for login and resolvers for data retrieval . Looks like this comes at the cost of multiple wasteful renderings if you have lots of streams of data getting resolved async . So the question . Is it ok to bypass this convention ? Using ngrx state store subscription and ditching resolvers + route subscription in the component in favor of guards that trigger the data request.Another strange behavior is that no matter what I do initally I still have a few AppCmp renderings which seem to be triggered by the observables themselves before the children comps are even Inited.EditI just had some trouble today . It was a mistake to use OnPush for container components such as pages ( smart components ) . The subscriptions will fire but the template will not receive the updated values . That 's expected from OnPush since no inputs are triggered . So I 'm using OnPush only on the dumb components , which is still a significant improvement since they do the bulk of the hard work.Edit 2 - Use resolvers , not guardsWell ... This did n't work out as expected . Let 's just say that if you have an observable that has n't fired yet , the guard will simply block the flow permanently . So my fancy example was working just because the observables had already some values inside that mapped to a true . After doing a thorough cleanup I found that my app stopped working.In essence , the following basic example works within a resolver but not a guard . This is because the observable ca n't get any value back the moment he asks for it so he just assumes it 's a no go . I 'll just have to investigate further where are those extra renderings coming from . There must be some faulty code somewhere ."

"In my app I have an array of objects with the following structureI 'd like to present this as a select menu which would allow a user to select a leaf node while still outputting non-selectable parent nodes to display the hierarchy of the structure.I 've tried a few approaches , the most successful of which was , in my angular template , something along the lines of the following . $ scope.allCats is the array above and $ scope.parentName ( ) method returns a string . The troubles with this are demonstrated in the following screenshot . Namely all parent items appear twice , once as an < option > and once as an < optgroup > , whereas I 'd rather they only appeared as a selectable item but with them being obviously a parent item , and the hierarchy of the structure is not maintained ; child nodes with ancestors and descendants do not appear in the correct 'family-tree ' structure.How can I alter my injected data or my angular template to achieve the behaviour I desire ? That is , to display the entire hierarchy , as defined by the parentID attributes so each family shares a common ancestor , and with parent items only appearing once.I suspect this is being complicated by the fact there is more than one level of descendants possible and because I would like to keep this as general as possible ."

"I am working on a medium size web application based on vue.js . I 've been facing several virtual DOM issues mostly related to vue instances life cycle.The following code snippet ( jsFiddle also available here ) demonstrates some of these problems . The test-component vue component receives a property value and updates its internal state using that value.Whenever the data set changes ( by sorting or by new data ) , the properties are updated , but the internal state is not . This is pretty easy to see by running the code snippet and clicking on the buttons.I understand the data component attribute is a function and it looks like it is invoked only when the component is created . That kind of explains what is going on . The thing is I do n't know how to achieve the intended behavior which is : all the children components internal state to be updated whenever the data source changes . Is there a life cycle callback that triggers when the component is '' refreshed '' ? I want a component refresh only callback . Do I need to watch for prop changes individually ? That would be ugly.Is there a clean way to update the internal state when the props change ? Is it possible to destroy all children components and force them to be recreated ? I know this is not the best option but it would solve all my data binding problems : ) How does vue decides when a component will be released or reused ? In my example components go away when the data set size changes from 4 to 3 , but the first 3 items internal state do n't change so the first three items are being recycled . Moving all the state to vuex would be a possible solution but some components are generic and I do n't want them to contain knowledge about the vuex store details . Actually I am using vuex for most components , but for truly generic components I do n't think it is a good option ."

"We 're currently building a website for mobile devices . Supported operating systems and browsers should be : Android 4.x ( Stock Browser , Google Chrome ) iOS6+ ( Safari , Google Chrome ) In order to also support high resolution displays we evaluated various techniques and libraries to automatically replace images with their high-res pendants : Attempt 1 : retina.jshttp : //retinajs.com/The first attempt was to use a normal < img > Tag like this : < img src= '' foo.png '' > and use retina.js to let it automatically replace the src Attribute with the name of the retina image ( foo @ 2x.png ) . This works but has 2 downsides : First , it will create unwanted overhead because both , the original as well as the retina image , would be loaded and second , if there is no retina image available it will cause lots of 404 errors on server log which we do not want.Attempt 2 : picturefill.jshttps : //github.com/scottjehl/picturefillThis framework uses some weird html markup based on < span > elements . For me it looks like as if the author tried to mimic the proposed < picture > element which is not a standard ( yet ) , see http : //picture.responsiveimages.org - I do n't like this approach because of the weird markup . For me it does n't make sense to semantically describe images with spans.Attempt 3 : Replace images via CSS property background-imageI see sometimes people using CSS media queries to detect retina displays and then set a background-image on a div ( or similar element ) with a higher or lower solution picture . I personally do n't like this approach either because it completely discourages creating semantically good markup à la < img src= '' foo.png '' > . I ca n't imagine building a website just with div 's and then set all images as background images - This just feels very weird.Attempt 4 : Set images via CSS property content : url ( ... ) As proposed here Is it possible to set the equivalent of a src attribute of an img tag in CSS ? it seems to be possible to overwrite the src Attribute in img Tags via CSS using the property content : url ( ) . Now , here is the plan : We set img tags for each image with a transparent blank 1x1 png referenced in its src attribute , like this : < img id= '' img56456 '' src= '' transp_1x1.png '' alt= '' img description '' > . Now this is semantically ok and also valid against the W3C validator . Then we load a CSS Stylesheet that sets all the images on the website via Media Queries.Example : Now , this approach works pretty good : No overheadSolid markupWorks on the required devices/browsersSEO for Images is not requirement hereNow , could this approach cause any side effects we did n't think of ? I am just asking because I know it works but kinda `` feels '' weird to set all images via CSS and I also found this comment on this approach on SO Is it possible to set the equivalent of a src attribute of an img tag in CSS ? : `` Worth to add that even in browsers that support assigning content to img , it changes its behavior . The image starts to ignore size attributes , and in Chrome/Safari it loses the context menu options like 'Save image ' . This is because assigning a content effectively converts img from empty replaced element to something like < span > < img > < /span > '' Could this be a problem ? ( I did n't notice any sizing problems and the context menu is not a requirement )"

"This is not a duplicate of questions such as this , but rather the opposite : I have a form that I 'm submitting via jQueryThis is done so that I can open a different page with HTML.Since I need to submit quite a lot of complex information , what I actually do is serialize them all into a big JSON string , then create a form with only one field ( `` payload '' ) and submit that.The receiving end has a filter that goes like this : if the method is POST , and there is only one submitted variable , and the name of that one variable is `` payload '' , then JSON-decode its value and use it to create fake GET data.So when the GET data grows too much I can switch methods without modifying the actual script , which notices no changes at all.It always worked until today.What should happenThe server should receive a single POST submission , and open the appropriate response in a popup window.What actually happens insteadThe server does receive the correct POST submission ... ... apparently ignores it ... ... and immediately after that , the browser issues a GET with no parameters , and it is the result of that parameterless GET that gets ( pardon the pun ) displayed in the popup window.Quite unsurprisingly , this is always a `` You did not submit any parameters '' error .

I ’ m trying to push the scrollbar down a few px when the user scrolls to the top of the < div > . The problem is that after the scroll is pushed down a few px ( after I scroll to the top ) the browser still thinks that my mouse is at the top of the < div > when my mouse is still held down ( mousedown ) . This is bad as the event keeps firing.Features I am trying to achieve : Scroll to the top of the < div > Scroll gets pushed down a few pixels but the function does not fire again even if my mouse is still on mouse down.I think it may be the way I detect the function through onscroll .

"I have an element which has been transformed with a matrix3d to give it perspective . It represents the screen of a handheld device.There 's a background image showing the handheld device itself , and this is not transformed . The element which holds this is positioned , and the screen element is positioned absolutely within it , at left : 0 ; top : 0 ; , and then transformed , with an origin in the top-left of the container . This was the easiest way for me to line it up perfectly with the background image ( I used this very handy tool to come up with the matrix ) , and it moves the screen element away from the corner.I want to be able to interact with the screen with mouse and touch events . To do this , on a click or touch event I need to find the coordinates in the local coordinate system of the screen element -- that is , the coordinates before the transform has taken place . In other words , when clicking the top-left of the handheld device 's screen ( which is not the top-left of its bounding box on the page ! ) I want [ 0 , 0 ] , and when clicking the top right of the screen , which in this transform 's case is actually further up on the page as well as to the right , I want [ untransformedWidth , 0 ] .Mouse events provide offsetX and offsetY which purportedly do exactly this ( more on that below ) , but the touch events do n't have these properties , so I need a way to calculate them myself.Using math.js I can feed in the transformation matrix and invert it . I have some code to loop over the CSS rules to get the transform : matrix3d ( ... ) rule ( I do n't want to repeat it in my code if I do n't have to ) , which I 'll skip over -- I know it works because the numbers match the CSS.Note that CSS has its matrix elements in column order , so matrix3d ( a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h , i , j , k , l , m , n , o , p ) looks in regular matrix notation like this : Meanwhile , math.js wants its matrices declared row by row , like [ [ a , e , i , m ] , [ b , f , j , n ] ... .So starting where I have a list of the number elements from inside the matrix3d ( ... ) expression , in CSS order , I 'm building and inverting the matrix like this : I then set up a mouse event handler on the screen element : If I move a marker ( relative to the container ) to this point [ x , y ] , it appears exactly where I clicked . So I know this much is working . I then multiply a vector of these coordinates by the inverse transformation matrix : If I move another marker ( this one relative to the screen element ) to the resulting vector 's values [ result.get ( [ 0 ] ) , result.get ( [ 1 ] ) ] it moves to roughly the same position as the previous marker , but it 's not quite right . It seems that the further from the origin I go , the more error there is , until it 's really quite bad towards the right and bottom edges.But then what if I check against offsetX and offsetY ? Well , it turns out that the answer depends on the browser.In Firefox , the coordinates found with offset* do n't match the clicked position either . They 're not quite the same as my calculated one , but only different by a couple of pixels . They 're just as far away from the true clicked point as my calculated values.But in Chrome the coordinates found with offset* are perfect.Here 's a jsfiddle.Is there anything I 'm doing wrong with my calculation ? Is there a way for me to mimic Chrome 's result , but without the offset* properties ?"

"I am looking to implement an O ( 1 ) lookup for binary quadkeys I know that there is no true hashtable for javascript , instead using objects and o ( 1 ) lookup with their properties , but the issue there is that the keys are always converted to strings.I suspect to have over a 10 million entries in memory , and if I have to rely on keys being strings and with the average quadkey string being 11.5 characters that would equate to ( 10 million entries * 11.5 length * 2 bytes ) = 230,000,000 bytes or 230 MB.Compared to storing as int64 ( 10 million entries * 8 bytes ) = 80,000,000 bytes or 80 MBI know that int64 is n't supported natively with javascript , but there are libraries that can assist with that in terms of doing the bitwise operations i 'd want.Now , even though there exists libraries that can deal with int64 , they are ultimately objects that are not truly representing 8 bytes , so I believe I can not use any int64 library in a hashtable , instead I was considering using 2-deep hash table with two int32 . The first key would be the first 4 bytes , and the 2nd key being the last 4 bytes . It 's not as ideal as 1 operation lookup to find a value , but 2 operations which is still good enough.However , I feel this is not worth it if all keys are stored as strings , or the fact that all numbers are double-precision floating-point format numbers ( 8 bytes ) so it each hash entry would then take up 16 bytes ( two `` int32 '' numbers ) .My questions are : 1 . If you store a number as the key to a property , will it take up 8 bytes of memory or will it convert to string and take up length*2bytes ? Is there a way to encode binary quadkeys into the double-precisionfloating-point format number standard that javascript has adopted , even if the number makes no sense , the underlying bits serve apurpose ( unique identification of a construct ) .PS : I am marking this with nodejs as there may exist libraries that could assist in my end goalEdit 1 : Seems 1 is possible with Map ( ) and node 0.12.x+As far as number 2 I was able to use a int64 lib ( bytebuffer ) and convert a 64int to a buffer.I wanted to just use the buffer as the key to Map ( ) but it would not let me as the buffer was internally an object , which each instance acts as a new key to Map ( ) .So I considered turning the buffer back into native type , a 64bit double.Using readDoubleBE I read the buffer as a double , which represents my 64int binary and successfully lets me use it in a map and allows for O ( 1 ) lookup . The code is sloppy and there are probably shortcuts I am missing , so any suggestions/hints are welcomed.Ideally I wanted to take advantage of bytebuffer 's varints so that I can have even more savings with memory but I was n't sure if that is possible in a Map , because I was n't able to use a buffer as a key.Edit 2 : Using memwatch-next I was able to see that max heap size was 497962856 bytes with this method with Set ( ) whereas using a string in Set ( ) was 1111082864 bytes . That is about 500MB vs 1GB , which is a far cry from 80mb and 230mb , not sure where the extra memory use is coming from . It 's worth nothing for these memory tests I used Set over Map that way it should only store unique keys in the data structure . ( Using Set as just a existence checker , where Map would serve as a lookup )"
"An article I was reading gives this as an example of an impure function ( in JavaScript ) : That struck me as a bit of an odd example , since tipPercentage is a constant with an immutable value .

"When developing a web app with jQuery or normal JavaScript , it is commonplace to check for feature availability first . So for example , if I want to use the document.oncopy event , I should first have something like this to ensure my code does n't break for lesser browsers : I 'm a bit puzzled about how this would work in Angular2 . I could still use the same if I expect to only run in the browser , but I 'm specifically told to leave the DOM alone if I want to use Angular Universal and depend on templates or the DomRenderer instead . This allows the page to be pre-rendered on the server and provides a truly impressive performance gain.But suppose I want a specific div to be invisible if the document.oncopy is unavailable . My understanding is that this is not recommended : and because then I 'm still manipulating the DOM . Note that my example is about the document.oncopy but I could choose any feature whatsoever that does n't have universal support.I tested this using Chris Nwamba 's tutorial on Scotch and added the following to the end of his Home template : Update : Interestingly , it gave different results on different browsers . On Chrome 55 , it executed as it would normally and showed the `` Feature is supported '' message . On IE11 , I received the `` not supported '' message . In both instances the server log shows a EXCEPTION : document is not defined message , but the page still seems perfectly okay.So what is the correct way to check for browser features if I want to use Angular Universal ? Update : I also toyed around with using a field in the template and assigning that field from one of the life cycle hooks . ngAfterContentInit seemed like a fine candidate , but also causes an error on the server . It still runs fine in the browser with no weird effects ( that I have noticed so far ) ."

"I am following this article on Social Logins with AngularJS and ASP.Net WebAPI ( which is quite good ) : ASP.NET Web API 2 external logins with Facebook and Google in AngularJS appPretty much , the code works fine when you are running the social login through a desktop browser ( i.e . Chrome , FF , IE , Edge ) . The social login opens in a new window ( not tab ) and you are able to use either your Google or Facebook account and once your are logged in through any of them , you are redirected to the callback page ( authComplete.html ) , and the callback page has a JS file defined ( authComplete.js ) that would close the window and execute a command on the parent window.the angularJS controller which calls the external login url and opens a popup window ( not tab ) on desktop browsers : loginController.jsauthComplete.htmlauthComplete.jsThe issue I am having is that when I run the application on a mobile device ( Safari , Chrome for Mobile ) , the social login window opens in a new tab and the JS function which was intended to pass back the fragment to the main application window does not execute nad the new tab does not close.You can actually try this behavior on both a desktop and mobile browser through the application : http : //ngauthenticationapi.azurewebsites.net/What I have tried so far in this context is in the login controller , I modified the function so that the external login url opens in the same window : And modified the authComplete.js common.getFragment function to return to the login page , by appending the access token provided by the social login as query string : And in the login controller , I added a function to parse the querystring and try to call the $ scope.authCompletedCB ( fragment ) function like : But obviously this is giving me an error related to angular ( which I have no clue at the moment ) : https : //docs.angularjs.org/error/ $ rootScope/inprog ? p0= $ digestSo , pretty much it is a dead end for me at this stage.Any ideas or input would be highly appreciated . Gracias ! Update : I managed to resolve the Angular error about the rootscope being thrown , but sadly , resolving that does not fix the main issue . If I tried to open the social login on the same browser tab where my application is , Google can login and return to the application and pass the tokens required . It is a different story for Facebook , where in the Developer 's tools console , there is a warning that seems to stop Facebook from displaying the login page.Pretty much , the original method with which a new window ( or tab ) is opened is the way forward but fixing the same for mobile browser seems to be getting more challenging ."

"ContextI 'm working with Angular . I have a service called UserService , that handles login , authentication and user data requests.The get method needs to check if the user has a valid ( not expired ) token for authentication before making the get request.So , if it has , make the request , if not , request a token and then make the request.ProblemThis get method needs to hide its complex requests . It has to return only a Promise as it was making only one request.So , an example of usage : Wrong solutionCheck if the token is expired . If it is , return a request to refresh the token , and there , make and return the get request . If it is not , just make and return the get request .

"I have the following code which prefetches and prerenders *specific links on hover , My question is , Do I need to add a new link each time , or is it enough that I change the href ? Will removing , changing the href cancel the pre-rendering/pre-fetching of a previously defined href or even remove it from cache ? Or since it was called once it stays in cache ? Also , Where can this be tested ? *Because Pre-rendering is an advanced experimental feature , and mis-triggering it can lead to a degraded experience for your users , including increased bandwidth usage , slower loading of other links , and slightly stale content .

"I 've got a special producer consumer problem in RxJS : The producer slowly produces elements . A consumer is requesting elements and often has to wait for the producer . This can be achieved by zipping the producer and the request stream : Sometimes a request gets aborted . A produced element should only consumed after a not aborted request : The first request r1 would consume the first produced element p1 , but r1 gets aborted by a ( r1 ) before it can consume p1 . p1 is produced and gets consumed c ( p1 , r2 ) on second request r2 . The second abort a ( ? ) is ignored , because no unanswered request happened before . The third request r3 has to wait on the next produced element p2 and is not aborted till p2 is produced . Thus , p2 is consumed c ( p2 , r3 ) immediately after it got produced.How can I achieve this in RxJS ? Edit : I created an example with a QUnit test on jsbin . You can edit the function createConsume ( produce , request , abort ) to try/test your solution.The example contains the function definition of the previously accepted answer ."

perfWhy do we build a prototype inheritance chain rather then using object composition . Looking up through the prototype for each step in the chain get 's expensive.Here is some dummy example code : uses pd because property descriptors are verbose as hell.o2.foo is faster then o1.foo since it only goes up two prototype chain rather then three.Since travelling up the prototype chain is expensive why do we construct one instead of using object composition ? Another better example would be : I do not see any code merging prototype objects for efficiency . I see a lot of code building chained prototypes . Why is the latter more popular ? The only reason I can think of is using Object.isPrototypeOf to test for individual prototypes in your chain.Apart from isPrototypeOf are there clear advantages to using inheritance over composition ?
"in my project I have a player walk around a globe . The globe is not just a sphere , it has mountains and valleys , so I need the players z position to change . For this I 'm raycasting a single ray from player 's position against a single object ( the globe ) and I get the point they intersect and change players position accordingly . I 'm only raycasting when the player moves , not on every frame.For a complex object it takes forever . It takes ~200ms for an object with ~1m polys ( faces ) ( 1024x512 segments sphere ) . Does raycasting cast against every single face ? Is there a traditional fast way to achieve this in THREE , like some acceleration structure ( octree ? bvh ? -- tbh from my google searches I have n't seem to find such a thing included in THREE ) or some other thinking-out-of-the-box ( no ray casting ) method ? Thank you in advance"

"I recently have been learning more JavaScript as I am going to be using it a lot for an upcoming internship . The company recommended many different resources for me to look at , but a friend of mine also suggested this website : https : //javascript30.com/I decided to give it a try and started yesterday on the first project which was a JavaScript drumkit.So the overall project was n't hard , but I noticed a little bug that was happening . So the project attaches a 'keydown ' event listener to several different HTML elements that trigger when either ASDFGHJKJL are pressed . In addition to playing a sound , the listener also attaches a class to the element that adds a little effect to the key being pressed.To remove the class , we attached a transitionend listener to the elements . So when the CSS property finishes the transition after the key is pressed , the class is then removed and the graphic goes back to normal in the browser . Now if you press the keys slowly , it works perfectly fine . But I noticed that if you were to hold a key down for a second or two , it appears as though the class that gets added is never removed and the graphic is permanent . I then checked the console and noticed that the transitionend event never fires once it gets stuck like that.Here is the code from the finished file.And this is how we attached the transitionend listener , not sure if this would have anything to do with itSo we put in the if loop in the removeTransition function so that it does n't remove the class for each property that is transitioning , but I noticed that when you remove the if loop , the page works perfectly . So I am not entirely sure what is going on with the transitionend event , and why it just stops firing entirely once it gets stuck like that . And also , why it works when the if loop is removed . Maybe it has more chances to remove the class when it loops through all of the properties ? No clue . Was wondering if anyone here might know what is going on . EDIT : I altered the playSound function a little bit to try and get to the bottom of this . So I added an if statement that checks if the element already contains the `` playing '' class once it gets stuck . I also added a classList.remove call to try and get rid of it in that same branch . What I found was once it gets stuck , and I press the key again , it branches off into that if statement and prints the console message , but STILL will not remove the `` playing '' class ."

"TL ; DR : Is there any way to rewrite this callback-based JavaScript code to use promises and generators instead ? BackgroundI have a Firefox extension written using the Firefox Add-on SDK . As usual for the SDK , the code is split into an add-on script and a content script . The two scripts have different kinds of privileges : add-on scripts can do fancy things such as , for example , calling native code through the js-ctypes interface , while content scripts can interact with web pages . However , add-on scripts and content scripts can only interact with each other through an asynchronous message-passing interface.I want to be able to call extension code from a user script on an ordinary , unprivileged web page . This can be done using a mechanism called exportFunction that lets one , well , export a function from extension code to user code . So far , so good . However , one can only use exportFunction in a content script , not an add-on script . That would be fine , except that the function I need to export needs to use the aforementioned js-ctypes interface , which can only be done in an add-on script . ( Edit : it turns out to not be the case that you can only use exportFunction in a content script . See the comment below . ) To get around this , I wrote a `` wrapper '' function in the content script ; this wrapper is the function I actually export via exportFunction . I then have the wrapper function call the `` real '' function , over in the add-on script , by passing a message to the add-on script . Here 's what the content script looks like ; it 's exporting the function lengthInBytes : And here 's the add-on script , where the `` real '' version of lengthInBytes is defined . The code here listens for the content script to send it a lengthInBytesCalled message , then calls the real version of lengthInBytes , and sends back the result in a lengthInBytesReturned message . ( In real life , of course , I probably would n't need to use js-ctypes to get the length of a string ; this is just a stand-in for some more interesting C library call . Use your imagination . : ) ) Finally , the user script ( which will only work if the extension is installed ) looks like this : What I want to doNow , the call to lengthInBytes in the user script is an asynchronous call ; instead of returning a result , it `` returns '' its result in its callback argument . But , after seeing this video about using promises and generators to make async code easier to understand , I 'm wondering how to rewrite this code in that style.Specifically , what I want is for lengthInBytes to return a Promise that somehow represents the eventual payload of the lengthInBytesReturned message . Then , in the user script , I 'd have a generator that evaluated yield lengthInBytes ( `` hello '' ) to get the result.But , even after watching the above-linked video and reading about promises and generators , I 'm still stumped about how to hook this up . A version of lengthInBytes that returns a Promise would look something like : and the user script would involve something likebut that 's as much as I 've been able to figure out . How would I write this code , and what would the user script that calls it look like ? Is what I want to do even possible ? A complete working example of what I have so far is here.Thanks for your help !"

I do not understand how the variable start reverts back to 16 after it reaches a value of 26 which is greater than 24.OK , after looking at this for sometime , I have a few questions that might clarify a few things:1 ) Is it a correct statement to say that each call to find keeps track of it 's own start value ? For example , when find ( 1 ) is called , it 's has a start value of 1 , when find ( 1 + 5 ) is called , find ( 1 ) 's start value is still one , but find ( 1 + 5 ) now has it 's own start value of 6.2 ) I am having a hard time following the stacktrace even if I see it printed out .

Why does it not do find ( 16 + 5 ) again ? Does it have something to do where find ( 21 + 5 ) and find ( 21 * 3 ) were called by find ( 16 ) and because those returned null into the calling function , it executed the second portion of the || statement which was find ( 16 * 3 ) ."

"Hey I have an iOS app with Watch Extension . When launching the Apple Watch app it launches the iPhone app and keeps it alive by sending sendMessage calls every couple of seconds . The iPhone app then navigates to a website in a WKWebView , checks its content every couple of seconds and then sends some of the data to the Apple Watch in order to be displayed there.Displaying the constantly-updating content on the Apple Watch works perfectly fine , I am getting the data on the iPhone like that : which I run every 5 seconds . As soon as the text in the article-title changes , the changes are visible on my Watch . Works.The elements all contain something like style= '' z-index : 206 ; height : ... and I successfully parse it by grabbing the attributes and then sub-stringing it down.I used the z-index value to sort the table rows on my Apple Watch but after 1-3 updates , the z-index of all the elements stopped updating . The contents ( like the article-title ) were still being updated so the data-flow was definitely working but I was wondering why the z-index ' stayed the same . At first I thought that it 's an issue with my sorting or during transfer to the Apple Watch but I was n't able to pin down this issue - when I ran the app on the iPhone , it always got the right index , but when I ran the app by launching it on the watch , the problem as described above appeared.After days of messing with data structures ( still thinking the error was on my side ) it finally hit me : when the app is launched in the background , the z-index on the page itself does n't get update . I checked this by launching the app on my Watch and getting the wrong z-index ' as usual but then I kept the Watch app open and launched the app on the iPhone - I saw the WKWebView updating the order of the elements according to their z-index and suddenly I got the right z-index for every element , even after pressing the home button . This explains a lot but still does n't really help me at solving the issue.How can I trick the WKWebView into letting the JS update all the elements z-index when it 's running in the background ? What I find weird is that this problem does n't occur after opening the iPhone app for a short period of time but I ca n't ask my users to open and `` minimize '' the app every time when wanting to access the Watch app as the purpose of a Watch app is to keep the phone in your pocket.Activating the iPhone app by sendMessage also calls viewDidLoad so there is no real difference that I can point out between launching the app on the phone manually and doing so by Watch . Javascript itself also works in the background so why would everything update except for the z-index attributes ? Preventing `` graphical '' updates running background would be understandable in regard to preserving battery life but is n't text `` graphical '' , too ? And why would it be different for a home-buttoned app if it 's been launched manually ? Removed because below only happened once , weird.EDIT : Ok so actually the index values change , but whenever one article gets pushed to the top , it goes to the same value as the highest value any article has without updating the value of the other ones . Example : It seems that WebKit has issues with the z-index so let 's see where the journey leads me"

"For a reaction time study ( see also this question if you 're interested ) we want to control and measure the display time of images . We 'd like to account for the time needed to repaint on different users ' machines.Edit : Originally , I used only inline execution for timing , and thought I could n't trust it to accurately measure how long the picture was visible on the user 's screen though , because painting takes some time.Later , I found the event `` MozAfterPaint '' . It needs a configuration change to run on users ' computers and the corresponding WebkitAfterPaint did n't make it . This means I ca n't use it on users ' computers , but I used it for my own testing . I pasted the relevant code snippets and the results from my tests below.I also manually checked results with SpeedTracer in Chrome . Results from comparing the durations measured using MozAfterPaint and inline execution.This does n't make me too happy . First , the median display duration is about 30ms shorter than I 'd like . Second , the variance using MozAfterPaint is pretty large ( and bigger than for inline execution ) , so I ca n't simply adjust it by increasing the setTimeout by 30ms . Third , this is on my fairly fast computer , results for other computers might be worse.Results from SpeedTracerThese were better . The time an image was visible was usually within 4 ( sometimes ) 10 ms of the intended duration . It also looked like Chrome accounted for the time needed to repaint in the setTimeout call ( so there was a 504ms difference between the call , if the image needed to repaint ) . Unfortunately , I was n't able to analyse and plot results for many trials in SpeedTracer , because it only logs to console . I 'm not sure whether the discrepancy between SpeedTracer and MozAfterPaint reflects differences in the two browsers or something that is lacking in my usage of MozAfterPaint ( I 'm fairly sure I interpreted the SpeedTracer output correctly ) .QuestionsI 'd like to knowHow can I measure the time it was actually visible on the user 's machine or at least get comparable numbers for a set of different browsers on different testing computers ( Chrome , Firefox , Safari ) ? Can I offset the rendering & painting time to arrive at 500ms of actual visibility ? If I have to rely on a universal offset , that would be worse , but still better than showing the images for such a short duration that the users do n't see them consciously on somewhat slow computers.We use setTimeout . I know about requestAnimationFrame but it does n't seem like we could obtain any benefits from using it : The study is supposed to be in focus for the entire duration of the study and it 's more important that we get a +/-500ms display than a certain number of fps . Is my understanding correct ? Obviously , Javascript is not ideal for this , but it 's the least bad for our purposes ( the study has to run online on users ' own computers , asking them to install something would scare some off , Java is n't bundled in Mac OS X browsers anymore ) .We 're allowing only current versions of Safari , Chrome , Firefox and maybe MSIE ( feature detection for performance.now and fullscreen API , I have n't checked how MSIE does yet ) at the moment ."

"There is a lot of advice out there that advises you to ensure that you do n't let any rejected promises go unhandled . If you do n't , the advices cautions , the errors will never be noticed , and will be completely swallowed . Nothing will be printed to the console.This advice seems to be out-of-date . Modern browsers and modern versions of Node do seem to print warnings when rejected promises are unhandled . Take this code : If you run this in Node , you will get : The standard advice is that the last line in the source code should look like this instead , to avoid swallowed errors : But it does n't look like that like was needed . So here are my questions : Is it true that modern browsers and modern Node will always show a warning for unhandled rejected promises ? What version numbers of the implementations support this ?

"I am very new to JavaScript and programming in general . I am currently in a little pickle with some code that I am playing around with , and I am wondering if anyone can give me some advice.Background : The code I am working with is rather simple ; There is a clock with the current time running on setInterval to update by the second . Below the clock there is a button that reads “ Stop , ” and when pressed , it will clear the Interval and the button will then read “ Start. ” If the button , which reads “ Start ” is pressed again , it will continue the clock timer in its current time . So basically this one button toggles the interval of the clock , and depending on which state it is , the button will read “ Start ” or “ Stop. ” W3Schools : JS Timing is where I am originally referencing when creating the code I am working with . This is where I am learning about how setInterval and clearInterval works . I also took some of the code in the examples and adjusted it so I can try to make the clock timer toggle off and on.Code : https : //jsfiddle.net/dtc84d78/Problem : So my problem with the code is that the button toggles from a “ Stop ” button to a “ Start ” button , but the clearInterval is not applying to the Variable with the setInterval.I have googled similar problems in SO , such as this one , and I followed their advice , and still nothing . After hours of trying to figure out , I decided to just copy and paste some example from W3Schools straight to jsFiddle , and that didn ’ t even work ( included in jsfiddle link ) ?

The .js file was then linked in between the head tags , and right before the end body tag . After @ Matz mentioned to stick the clock timer js code in the head section , the code worked great ! This is what it looks like so far in the head section.Though this works great , I now want to figure out as to why the clock timer js code works when it is directly in the head section as compared to keeping it in the external .js file ( with the external file being linked in the doc ) ? What can I do to make it work within the external file ?"

"I have some problems with a great circle distance calculation using a map.Context : http : //airports.palzkill.de/search/The map is supposed to work as a great circle distance search map - you move the circles center marker or the radius marker , and the circle gets smaller or larger . For debug purposes , the boxes title field shows the calculated distance in km.This only works fine as long as the circle center is close to 0/0 , and the radius marker is not too far away from it . The more you move either of the markers to `` extremes '' , the more off some tangent the whole thing goes and produces nothing but crap.This is the code used for calculating the updates , you can also find the entire code in the JS file js.js , lines 146 to 184 : Since the whole thing does calculate some correct output I assume the math itself is not totally wrong , I guess there is just some `` correctional '' stuff missing ? Unfortunately I am absolutely lousy at trigonometry , so I dont have a clue what might be wrong here , or even where to start searching for ideas about how to fix it.MarcoP.S . : I know that due to the spherical nature of the projection , the whole thing has to act `` counter-intuitive '' around the poles .

After running the script , I would expect the Description to look like this : `` The interface ( GUI ) shall be generated using only a pre-defined RGB Color Range . `` NOTE : even though `` fine '' does appear in the Description ( defined ) , it shall not be marked.I thought of splitting the description of each item into words but then I miss all the glossary items which have more than 1 word . My current idea is to look for each item in the list in each of the descriptions but I have the following limitations : I need to find only matches for the exact items in the 2 lists ( single and multiple words ) The search has to be case insensitiveItems found may be at the beginning or end of the text and separated by various symbols : space , comma , period , parentheses , brackets , etc.I have the following code which works but is not case-insensitive : Can someone please help with making this case-insensitive ?

I 've inherited some Javascript code and I 'm not really a Javascript expert.We have an object that acts like a collection of hashes and values called buckets . It has properties that are the hash value and each property is an object .

This code has worked flawlessly for at least 3 years . In the past week or two it stopped working in Chrome . Still works fine in IE ( not sure about FF ) . It seems to me that it ought to continue to work . I 've validated that buckets contains the hash property being searched .

For example : Now , I 've done some testing , and a chunkSize that yields about a 100ms execution time and a 1ms timeout seem to yield a pretty responsive UI , but some examples I 've seen recommend much larger chunks ( ~300ms ) and longer timeouts ( 20 to 100 ms ) .

"I have a few sortables with CSS3 keyframe animations defined on them through a class . When sorting , I 've noticed strange behaviour as seen in this Fiddle.Initiating jQuery sortable.The animation triggers on sort start and stop , while the animation class is not being reapplied . It 's seems like there is some sort of reflow going on caused by jQuery modifying the DOM . But how does it keep triggering the animation , and can it be avoided ? The goal is to have no animation at all when sorting , while keeping the class.Answer : It makes sense , since the item we 're dragging around is just a clone , it animates on start because we insert the clone to the DOM . The animation occurring on stop has the same cause , since the clone is then being append to it 's new position , again triggering a reflow of the document ."

The timer will stop if you immediately set focus to the comment textarea after closing the alert at document ready.After removing focus , and the first cycle of the interval timer completes , the timer will not stop again .

While I am trying to learn jquery I learned that $ ( selector ) returns an object which has all the match of that selector and is iterable like arrays . eg $ ( `` button '' ) will return an object that will have access to all the button tag of DOM in such way that to access the first button tag you can use $ [ `` button '' ] [ 0 ] for second you can use $ [ `` button '' ] [ 1 ] and so on.So here below is code focus on commented line 1 and line 2.line 2 inside line1 event handler function is set up an infinite loop as you can see that when I Click on `` Click me '' button it will trigger line1 inside of which is line 2 which too will again trigger line 1 and so on.now see the below code snippet with changed line2.This time it is not setting up an infinite loop but prints to console `` 1 '' only two times why so ?

"I 'm using System.js to load modules written in TypeScript .

I 'm missing some kind of option , to associate the module specifier with a certain URL , let 's say as an attribute to a < script > tag.A pragmatic solution would be to just go back to use the UMD builds of modules , which are installed into the global namespace and allows me to explictly list all dependencies in the main HTML file.But I 'm interested in the conceptual story . The bundler tools tell it as they will be obsolete in the future when there is native support , but as of now , the browser support is pretty useless , because the ecosystem is probably not consistently going to shift to importing modules by relative paths ."

So quotes are required around `` first-name '' , but are optional around `` first_name '' .And the following is the example of an object literal provided in the book : Now , I might have misinterpreted the text here but to me it seems like Mr. Crockford is saying first-name ( with the hyphen ) IS a reserved word whereas first_name ( with the underscore ) is not .

My understanding of === means it could return false if the type of obj.length did n't match the type of +obj.length , but here my knowledge falls short . What kinds of things could + do to the kinds of things that obj.length might be ? Is x === +x some sort of generic idiomatic test that I just do n't know ? Is it response to some sort of special case that arises deeper in underscore.js , e.g. , does underscore.js assign and track negative object.lengths for some conventional purpose ? Guidance and advice will be much appreciated ."

I want to split string to using javascript split ( ) Can you please help ?
"Suppose that I 've got a node.js application that receives input in a weird format : strings with JSON arbitrarily sprinkled into them , like so : This is a string { `` with '' : '' json '' , '' in '' : '' it '' } followed by more text { `` and '' : { `` some '' : [ `` more '' , '' json '' ] } } and more textI have a couple guarantees about this input text : The bits of literal text in between the JSON objects are always free from curly braces.The top level JSON objects shoved into the text are always object literals , never arrays.My goal is to split this into an array , with the literal text left alone and the JSON parsed out , like this : So far I 've written a naive solution that simply counts curly braces to decide where the JSON starts and stops . But this would n't work if the JSON contains strings with curly braces in them { `` like '' : '' this one } right here '' } . I could try to get around that by doing similar quote counting math , but then I also have to account for escaped quotes . At that point it feels like I 'm redoing way too much of JSON.parse 's job .

"When I am developing in jQuery , I frequently find myself typing selectors into the Chrome/Firebug console and seeing what they give me . They are always nicely formatted as if they were arrays : I am trying to work out what it is that makes the console treat an object as an array .

"So I am a TA for a class at my University , and I have a bit of a disagreement about how to present datatypes for absolute beginner programmers ( In which most never programmed before ) . My teacher tells students they must strictly use constructors to create primitive datatypes such as Numbers and Strings , her reasoning is to treat JavaScript as if its strongly typed so students will be used to the languages that are in the future . I understand why , but I think it has bad trade-offs.My instructor does not make a distinction between these and students are told to treat them as if they are primitive Numbers , Strings , etc . Although I believe at least for starters who do n't know better to use datatype.valueOf ( ) when necessary , and do n't know much at all what objects are yet . Literal notation would be ( and I consider it to be ) more proper and standard , the other way would cause confusion .

"I have an array of elements which the user can not only edit , but also add and delete complete array elements . This works nicely , unless I attempt to add a value to the beginning of the array ( e.g . using unshift ) .Here is a test demonstrating my problem : The first two tests pass just fine . However the third test fails . In the third test I attempt to prepend `` z '' to my inputs , which is successful , however the second input also shows `` z '' , which it should not . ( Note that hundreds of similar questions exist on the web , but in the other cases people were just not having unique name-attributes and they are also just appending , not prepending ) .Why is this happening and what can I do about it ? Notes on trackBySo far the answers were just `` use trackBy '' . However the documentation for trackBy states : By default , the change detector assumes that the object instance identifies the node in the iterableSince I do n't supply an explicit trackBy-Function , that means that angular is supposed to track by identity , which ( in the case above ) absolutely correctly identifies each object and is inline with what the documentation expects.The answer by Morphyish basically states that the feature to track by identity is broken and proposes to use an id-Property . At first it seemed to be a solution , but then it turned out to be just an error . Using an id-Property exhibits the exact same behavior as my test above.The answer by penleychan tracks by index , which causes angular to think , that after I unshifted a value angular thinks that actually I pushed a value and all values in the array just happened to have updated . It kind of works around the issue , but it is in violation to the track-By contract and it defeats the purpose of the track-by-function ( to reduce churn in the DOM ) ."

"I 'm writing an app which for various reasons involves Internet Explorer ( IE7 , for the record ) , ActiveX controls , and a heroic amount of JavaScript , which is spread across multiple .js includes . One of our remote testers is experiencing an error message and IE 's error message says something to the effect of : There 's only one JavaScript file which has over 719 lines and line 719 is a blank line ( in this case ) .None of the HTML or other files involved in the project have 719 or more lines , but the resulting HTML ( it 's sort of a server-side-include thing ) , at least as IE shows from `` View Source '' does have 719 or more lines - but line 719 ( in this case ) is a closing table row tag ( no JavaScript , in other words ) .The results of `` View Generated Source '' is only 310 lines in this case.I would imagine that it could possibly be that the entire page , with the contents of the JavaScript files represented inline with the rest of the HTML could be where the error is referring to but I do n't know any good way to view what that would be , So , given a JavaScript error from Internet Explorer where the line number is the only hint but the page is actually spread across multiple files ? UPDATE : The issue is exacerbated by the fact that the user experiencing this is remote and for various network reasons , debugging it using something like Visual Studio 2008 ( which has awesome JavaScript debugging , by the way ) is impossible . I 'm limited to having one of us look at the source to try and figure out what line of code it 's crapping out on.UPDATE 2 : The real answer ( as accepted below ) seems to be `` no , not really '' .

"I have multiple grids that display data based on a given filter ( in a web application using a REST Api ) . The data structure displayed is always the same ( to simplify the problem ) , but depending on the screen on which the user is , the displayed results are different.In addition , and this is the issue , some results must be disabled so that the user can not select them.Example : A Foo has N Bars . If I want to add a new child ( bar ) to the father ( foo ) , I go to the search screen , but I want the filtered grid shows as disabled children which are already related to the father.Currently I 'm controlling this issue on the server ( database querys ) by doing specifics joins depending on the scenario and `` disabling '' results I do n't want . But this approach causes I can not reuse queries ( due to specifics joins . Maybe I need to search Bars int order relate them with other father Baz , and I want disable Bars that are already related with current father ... ) Another approach could be the following : Save the children ( only ids ) related to the father in an array in memory ( javascript ) In the `` prerender '' grid event ( or similar ) check for each element whether it is contained in the previous array or not ( search by id ) . If so , mark it as disabled ( for example ) .This is a reusable solution in client-side and I can always reuse the same query in server side.Before starting to implement this solution I would like to know if there is any better option.I 'm sure this is a recurring problem and I do n't want to reinvent the wheel.Any strategy or suggestion ? Edit : show example : Assuming this model : I have two different screens : one showing items belongs to one category and another showing items belongs to one sales promotion . In each screen I can search for items and add them to the Category or SalesPromotion . But when I 'm searching items , I want items that already belongs to Category/SalesPromotion to show as disabled ( or not shown , for simplicity in this example ) .I can do this in server , doing queries like these : You can imagine what happens if I had more and more scenarios like these ( with more complex model and queries of course ) .One alternative could be : Store items that already belongs to current Category/SalesPromotion in memory ( javascript , clientside ) .On grid prerender event ( or equivalent ) in clientside determine what items must be disabled ( by searching each row in stored items ) .So , my question is wheter this approach is a good solution or is there a well-known solution for this issue ( I think so ) ."

"I want to calculate the length of a line for a series of events.I 'm doing this with the following code.This works , but I 'm using linear scaling , while I 'd like to use logarithms , because I do n't want small events to become too small numbers when big ones are present . I modified the lineLen function as you can see below , but - obviously - it does n't work for events equals to one , because the log of one is zero . I want to show events equals to one ( opportunely scaled ) and not make them become zero . I also need positive numbers to remain positive ( 0.1 becomes a negative number ) How should I modify lineLen to use a logarithmic scale ?"
"I 'm a part time newish developer working on a Chrome extension designed to work as an internal CR tool . The concept is simple , on a keyboard shortcut , the extension gets the word next to the caret , checks it for a pattern match , and if the match is 'true ' replaces the word with a canned response . To do this , I mostly used a modified version of this answer . I 've hit a roadblock in that using this works for the active element , but it does n't appear to work for things such as the 'compose ' window in Chrome , or consistently across other services ( Salesforce also seems to not like it , for example ) . Poking about a bit I thought this might be an issue with iFrames , so I tinkered about a bit and modified this peace of code : ( Which I originally got from another SO post I can no longer find ) . Seems as though I 'm out of luck though , as no dice .

"Having a problem with AJAX and Masonry grid . Masonry grid is simple not being initiated at the right moments.Before scrolling or using the parametric search to go to a specific category , it works very well.Sample site can be found here.MasonryMasonry is a JavaScript grid layout library . Used normally with Bootstrap or another grid system that does not align the items correctly . Example : Only bootstrap : Bootstrap and Masonry : When scrollingThe next columns are being added above the older ones . Giving almost the same output as unloaded images which makes images overlapping . This is normally solved by using imagesLoaded which I have already included in the provided code.When using parametric searchThe Masonry is not being fired after the AJAX . Meaning it does not work at all . So the columns are being loaded without Masonry.Please see sample site.Both scrolling and parametric search is delivered by Toolset . They have a good system with making it very easy to load JS at specific times : After the AJAX Pagination with Toolset has been completed.When parametric search has been triggered.When the parametric search data has been collected.When the parametric search form has been updated.When the parametric search results have been updated.So both after pagination and before/during/after Parametric search . Since the problem is after scrolling , and after the results for Parametric search has been updated , I would like to initiate the Masonry grid at this very moment.The easiest example is when the scrolling is done , or pagination as it 's also called.What I have triedI used reloadItems as I guessed would be correct . Please correct me if I am wrong . Resource.In my theory it would reload all the items when scrolling , so they would be arranged properly . But it changes nothing.I have also tried the following : I also tried to reload the items when the parametric search results has been updated.But this did not work either.The Masonry is also added in the footer by using one of the methodes.Do you have any ideas ?

"JavaScript is a prototyped-based language , and yet it has the ability to mimic some of the features of class-based object-oriented languages . For example , JavaScript does not have a concept of public and private members , but through the magic of closures , it 's still possible to provide the same functionality . Similarly , method overloading , interfaces , namespaces and abstract classes can all be added in one way or another.Lately , as I 've been programming in JavaScript , I 've felt like I 'm trying to turn it into a class-based language instead of using it in the way it 's meant to be used . It seems like I 'm trying to force the language to conform to what I 'm used to.The following is some JavaScript code I 've written recently . It 's purpose is to abstract away some of the effort involved in drawing to the HTML5 canvas element.The code works exactly like it should for a user of Shape.Circle , but it feels like it 's held together with Duct Tape .

"From the jQuery docs javascript guide : Because local scope works through functions , any functions defined within another have access to variables defined in the outer function : Console triggered with debugger : Since variables defined in the outer function can be used by the inner function ( E.g . x or y ) , why is the debugger not able to call the y variable ? I suspect people will answer that the debugger only shows variables defined in the most inner/local scope . The reason for this being that otherwise no distinction could be made using the debugger between the inner and outer scope when inspecting a variable using the debugger in the inner function.Additionally , every variable defined in an outer scope which is executed in the inner scope allows the debugger to access it.But if that is the case , is n't there some way to still call the variable y from the console inside the inner function ? ( using a notation respectful of scope , e.g . outer.y ) Edit : Debuggers in other languagesApparently this behavior of a debugger is not limited to javascript . The Python debugger pdb for example behaves similarly :"

But apparently it 's pretty hard to create deep builds from NPM packages with RequireJS or SystemJS , and in this case I need a deep build that includes many NPM deps .

"I 'd like to use IndexedDB to process a lot of data . Too much data to fit in memory . To do this , I would like to use Firefox 's IndexedDB persistent storage , which allows me to store more than 2GB worth of data ( Firefox apparently has a limit of 2GB imposed on non-persistent storage ) .However , I 've run into an issue . Firefox does not appear to be imposing a limit on the amount of data I can store in persistent storage . In fact , if I leave the following sample running , it will apparently run until the disk is full ! Sample ( Online ) ( Must be run in Firefox ! ) : For obvious reasons , filling up a user 's drive is not ideal . If the user does not have enough free disk space , it would be better not to try to run it at all , or at-least stop when more-than X % full.Strangely , according to MDN , it seems like the browser should be imposing a limit on the amount of data stored : The maximum browser storage space is dynamic — it is based on your hard drive size . The global limit is calculated as 50 % of free disk space . In Firefox , an internal browser tool called the Quota Manager keeps track of how much disk space each origin is using up , and deletes data if necessary.So if your hard drive is 500GB , then the total storage for a browser is 250GB . If this is exceeded , a process called origin eviction comes into play , deleting entire origin 's worth of data until the storage amount goes under the limit again . There is no trimming effect put in place , to delete parts of origins — deleting one database of an origin could cause problems with inconsistency.There 's also another limit called group limit — this is defined as 20 % of the global limit . Each origin is part of a group ( group of origins ) . There 's one group for each eTLD+1 domain.However , my testing never threw any errors while it filled up the drive.Now my question is , is there any way to ensure putting a lot of data into Firefox 's IndexedDB persistent storage will not fill up a user 's drive , and make them very , very angry ?"

"Working on a rummy style game with several twists : Using two 5 suite decks instead of one 4 suite deck ( 116 cards total ) .Suites run from 3 to King and each deck has 3 jokers ( so no 2 and no Ace ) .11 rounds , first round each player has 3 cards , final round each player has 13 cards.Besides Jokers being wild , each card value takes a turn being wild and this corresponds to the number of cards in your hand.So round one 3 's are wild round two 4 's are wild ... round 11 Kings are wild ( Kings have a numeric value of 13 ) . The goal is to lay down all your cards . Once someone has 'gone out ' ( laid down all cards ) remaining players have one turn to also lay down all cards or as many valid sets/runs as they can . You gain points for whatever cards are left in your hand.Players can only lay cards down in sets or runs that have a minimum of 3 cards in them , i.e set : { 3 : c , 3 : d , 3 : h } , run : { 3 : c , 4 : c , 5 : c } . There are also rounds where you have to get a set/run with more then 3 cards because the number of cards in hand is not evenly divisible by 3.To start hand evaluation I split the cards into these structures : And then delete any suites/buckets that do n't have any cards in them.Set evaluation is pretty straight forward but run evaluation is ... not so straight forward.I 've come up with this range based run evaluationThis works for a lot of cases but it struggles with duplicates in the suite.One of the toughest cases I 've run into while play-testing it is along the following lines : { 3 : clubs , wild , 3 : spades , 4 : clubs , 5 : clubs , 6 : clubs , 6 : clubs 7 : clubs , 8 : clubs , 10 : spades , 10 : hearts , wild } So 12 cards in hand and a valid lay down can be formed : which would look like this : sets : [ { 3 : c , 3 : s , wild } , { 10 : s , 10 : h , wild } ] runs : [ { 4 : c , 5 : c , 6 : c } , { 6 : c , 7 : c , 8 : c } ] Unfortunately I end up with something along these lines : sets : [ { 6 : c , 6 : c , wild } , { 10 : s , 10 : h , wild } ] runs : [ { 3 : c,4 : c,5 : c } ] OR ( depending on if I evaluate for sets or runs first ) sets : [ { 10 : s , 10 : h , wild , wild } ] runs : [ { 3 : c , 4 : c , 5 : c , 6 : c , 7 : c , 8 : c } ] with the other cards left over.I also run into issues in early rounds when I have hands like this : { 6 : h , 7 : h , 7 : h , 8 : h } The above is an issue when trying to lay down a partial hand . { 6 : h , 7 : h , 8 : h } is a valid run in partial hand situations and the player would only be left with 7 points . But because I do n't get rid of duplicates it does n't evaluate this as a possible run and the player is left with all the points ( 28 ) .My question is : Is there a better way/algorithm for doing this entire process ? My current thoughts for solving this are kinda depressing as they involve lots of case/if statements for specific hand lengths/game situations/suite lengths . Where sometime I remove duplicates sometimes I do n't sometimes I split the suite sometimes I do n't ... Lots of headaches basically where I 'm not sure that I 've covered all possible hands/partial lay down situations ."

The mechanism that Javascript provides to do this is messy and complex , but it can be significantly simplified . We will add a create method to the Object function . The create method creates a new object that uses an old object as its prototype.I could manually add this code to all my Javascript projects , but keeping track of everything would be a huge pain.Are there any libraries that implement The Good Part 's recommendations and thereby save me the trouble of having to keep track of them ( / physically type them all out ) ?"

"This is a somewhat noob-question for someone who had a few years of web development experience , but after not finding the answer on either Programmer Stack Exchange or Google , I have decided to ask it here.I am using Express web framework for Node.js , but this question is not specific to any web framework or programming language.Here 's a list of games that are queried from the database . Each game entity is a single table row , generated using a for-loop : Each Rating block , as well as each Buy button/modal dialog are generated by the for-loop with an id that matches the game . For example , the Buy button for Assassin 's Creed will have id= '' price-assassins-creed '' . # { variable } - is how you reference a variable in Jade , passed in from the server.andandMultiply that by the number of games and that 's how many inline scripts I have on one page.Worse yet , I have to account for the following cases : User 's not logged-in : display above rating script in read-only mode.User 's logged-in , but has n't voted yet : ... in that case , use the following script : User 's logged-in but suspended from rating : Copy and paste yet another read-only script for this particular if-else condition.Long story short , it has become a maintenance nightmare trying to maintain all this JavaScript in my .jade template files , and my markup looks unacceptably dirty.What 's a solution for this ? This seems like such a common scenario for CRUD applications . Ideally I would like to move all javascript to a separate .js file . But if I could remove some code duplication , that would be great too . The problem is if I move inline javascript to a separate file how do I know which game am I rating ? How do I know which Buy button has user clicked on ? Right now there is no ambiguity because for N games I have N buy buttons , N modal dialogs and N rating scripts . Regardless of what anyone thinks of this style of programming , it 's an awful way to maintain the code.Please share some insight with a noobie ! Thank you in advance.Here 's a complete code snippet of my games.jade file :"

"I 've got a card component that wraps another different components inside . It 's like a wrapper component for making the UI fancy ; I guess you have seen this approach many times.Thing is , I want these cards to be hideable , just showing the footer ( which , by the way , is also created by the child component , not the card itself ) .Therefore , my approach to handle animations , is : I click in the icon that switches the card between visible and hidden.It outputs ( with @ Output ( ) ) some variable that is used in the child element for hiding the part of the component you only want to show when the card is `` activated '' .This same variable is used in two different animations : one in the card , for making it smaller , and other in the inner component , for hiding the part that you do n't want to show when the card is `` deactivated '' .You can see the big picture with these little snippets , starting by the implementation : Inner component : Parent component ( card ) : Okay , this approach `` works '' .

Not even changing the duration . None of these changes avoid these bugs from happening , and absolutely , no one makes it do what I want : make that part of the component appear slowly , so the opacity grows/lowers down slowly from one state to the another , instead of suddenly appearing/disappearing ."

"I am interested in the scenario where we have some function f which is recursive and which we are not provided the source code to . I would like a function memoizer : Function - > Function which takes in say f and returns a function g such that g = f ( in the sense they return the same value given the same arguments ) which when called first checks if the called arguments are in its 'cache ' ( memory of results it has calculated before ) and if so returns the result from this , otherwise it should compute f , should f call itself with some arguments , this is tantamount to calling g with those arguments and I would like that f first check if the cache of g contains those arguments and if so return the result from this , otherwise ... This is easy ( in Javascript ) to do given the source code of f , I simply define memoize in the obvious way and do something like But this does n't appeal to me at all ( mainly because I might want a memoized and non memoized version of the same function and then I 'd have to write the same function twice ) and wo n't work if I do n't know how to implement f.In case it 's not clear what I 'm asking , I would like a function memoize which takes a function such as And returns some new function g such that fact ( n ) = g ( n ) for all n and which for example when g ( 10 ) is computed stores the values of fact ( 0 ) , ... , fact ( 10 ) which are computed while computing g ( 10 ) and then if I ask for say g ( 7 ) it finds the result in the cache and returns it to me.I 've thought that conceptually it 's possible to detect when f is called since I have it 's address and maybe I could replace all calls to f with a new function where I compute f and store the result and then pass the value on to where it would normally go .

"Currently working on a react + redux project.I 'm also using normalizr to handle the data structure and reselect to gather the right data for the app components . All seems to be working well.I find myself in a situation where a leaf-like component needs data from the store , and thus I need to connect ( ) the component to implement it.As a simplified example , imagine the app is a book editing system with multiple users gathering feedback.At different levels of the app , users may contribute to the content and/or provide comments.Consider I 'm rendering a Chapter , it has content ( and an author ) , and comments ( each with their own content and author ) .Currently I would connect ( ) and reselect the chapter content based on the ID.Because the database is normalised with normalizr , I 'm really only getting the basic content fields of the chapter , and the user ID of the author . To render the comments , I would use a connected component that can reselect the comments linked to the chapter , then render each comment component individually.Again , because the database is normalised with normalizr , I really only get the basic content and the user ID of the comment author.Now , to render something as simple as an author badge , I need to use another connected component to fetch the user details from the user ID I have ( both when rendering the chapter author and for each individual comment author ) .The component would be something simple like this : And it seemingly works fine.I 've tried to do the opposite and de-normalise the data back at a higher level so that for example chapter data would embed the user data directly , rather than just the user ID , and pass it on directly to User – but that only seemed to just make really complicated selectors , and because my data is immutable , it just re-creates objects every time.So , my question is , is having leaf-like component ( like User above ) connect ( ) to the store to render a sign of anti-pattern ? Am I doing the right thing , or looking at this the wrong way ?"

"What I was trying to accomplish . I wanted to share a single canvas ( because what I 'm doing is very heavy ) and so I thought I 'd make a limited resource manager .

"First off I 'm a bit new to SVG . I just started working on a gantt-ish style timeline/roadmap for products supported in my area . Each item has a category , and subcategory , and then a number of versions . Each product ends up as its own separate mini-chart . The SVG is produced by d3.js , however the issue does n't seem to be related to the JavaScript.The example SVG is here : http : //plnkr.co/edit/ipqZIZODDN4lYKVeLt73Fundamentally there are two g groups that should be stacked on top of each other . In the example there is red and blue outline respectively . The blue group should be directly below the red group . To position the blue group I measured the height of the red group using getBBox . I then use that height and the transform attribute on blue group.Here are the relevant groups : Note : these groups are contained within numerous other groups , however no transformations ( with the exception of translate ( 0,0 ) ) are applied to these groups.In the example if you use the chrome inspector to measure the height of the red group , it is 121 pixels : So the 122 used for the translate for the blue group should be fine . However when rendered the red and blue groups overlap significantly : In fact if you adjust the numbers in the chrome inspector you need an offset of 143 pixels : transform= '' translate ( 0,143 ) '' , before the two groups align in the way I want them : Are the units for the translation not in pixels ? I do n't see any obvious reason why the 122 unit translation would n't move the group 122 pixels unless that was so . It does render the same way in IE11 so it must be something about SVGs or this markup that I 'm not aware of.Does anyone have any ideas ? UpdateThis morning I took some screenshots and measured the pixel values of the boxes . The blue box is indeed 121 pixels tall just as getBBox and the various browser inspectors I 've used suggest . I then measured the offset and found that what is supposed to be a 122 pixel translation down is , in fact only 100 pixels . Further if using the manually corrected translation ( which is 143 pixels down ) , the correct 121 pixel offset is measured : Issue appears in IE11 , IE11-Edge ( Spartan ) , Chrome 40 , and Firefox 36 . With every modern browser rendering nearly the same , this has to be an issue with the markup , right ? So where 's the missing 22 pixels going ?"

Does any one know about optimization effects of passing in a variable via function arguments versus having the variable available via a closure ? It seems like passing in variables via function arguments would be faster since objects are copied by reference ( so fast copy time ) and climbing the scope environments of the function requires checking the environment at each level . Here 's the gist of what I meanversusWhich in theory performs faster ?

"When defining an ng-repeat directive to iterate over an array , the syntax specifies ng-repeat= '' friend in friends '' , and then within the template you use the interoplation operator like so { { friend.name } } .Is it possible to have the properties assigned to the current item scope , rather than a variable in it ? So I could call just { { name } } instead of { { friend.name } } ? The reason being is that my directive is being used in the scope of two different templates - for example I might have a directive `` userActions '' that is used in both a repeater , and also inside an unrelated template where { { friend.name } } does n't make sense . I would like to avoid artificially manufacturing the friend object where it does n't have a semantic meaning.My use case is something like this : I have a grid that renders blocks of various types . Some psuedo code : I also have a friend page , that contains the exact same user actions : Now , if I want to user a property of the block inside the repeater , the syntax is { { block.name } } . So the template for userActions contains this.However , once I use this template in the friend page , I must create { { block.name } } inside the scope of the friend controller . This does not make sense though , because the block only exists in the context of the block grid . I should n't have to create this block .

"So I was curious what would be faster for iterating through an array , the normal for loop or forEach so I executed this code in the console : Now the results in Chrome are 49ms for the for loop , 376ms for the forEach loop . Which is ok but the results in Firefox and IE ( and Edge ) are a lot different.In both other browsers the first loop takes ~15 seconds ( yes seconds ) while the forEach takes `` only '' ~4 seconds.My question is can someone tell me the exact reason Chrome is so much faster ? I tried all kinds of operations inside the loops , the results were always in favor for Chrome by a mile ."

"as ECMAScriptv5 , each time when control enters a code , the enginge creates a LexicalEnvironment ( LE ) and a VariableEnvironment ( VE ) , for function code , these 2 objects are exactly the same reference which is the result of calling NewDeclarativeEnvironment ( ECMAScript v5 10.4.3 ) , and all variables declared in function code are stored in the environment record componentof VariableEnvironment ( ECMAScript v5 10.5 ) , and this is the basic concept for closure.What confused me is how Garbage Collect works with this closure approach , suppose I have code like : after the line var f2 = f1 ( ) , our object graph would be : so as from my little knowledge , if the javascript engine uses a reference counting method for garbage collection , the object o has at lease 1 refenrence and would never be GCed . Appearently this would result a waste of memory since o would never be used but is always stored in memory.Someone may said the engine knows that f2 's VariableEnvironment does n't use f1 's VariableEnvironment , so the entire f1 's VariableEnvironment would be GCed , so there is another code snippet which may lead to more complex situation : in this case , f2 uses the o1 object which stores in f1 's VariableEnvironment , so f2 's VariableEnvironment must keep a reference to f1 's VariableEnvironment , which result that o2 can not be GCed as well , which further result in a waste of memory.so I would ask , how modern javascript engine ( JScript.dll / V8 / SpiderMonkey ... ) handles such situation , is there a standard specified rule or is it implementation based , and what is the exact step javascript engine handles such object graph when executing Garbage Collection.Thanks ."

"Is there a way in ReactJS for a component to find out who it 's parent is ? EDIT 1 : Regardless of the merits of doing this , is there a way ? I have n't found a React way to do this - from what I can see , the idea is to pass callbacks down to the child from the parent , and the child calls the callback - unaware of the fact that the callback is actually on the parent.I 've tried setting an `` owner '' property , and that idea seems to work , but I wonder what 's the best approach ? e.g.Then in the child component , I can do owner.method , and it seems to work fine . I know this is n't a true parent/child relationship , but is the closest I 've found in my tests.Some may say that callbacks are a cleaner way of doing this , but the parent/child relationship for some things ( e.g . RadioButtonGroup and RadioButton ) seems natural and would benefit from knowing this relationship , in my opinion.EDIT 2 : So it 's not possible ? The thing that I do n't like about the idea that it 's not supported isthat HTML can be marked up with zero javascript - and it has implied , default functionality - some elements are required to have parents -they are defined as children of other elements ( e.g . ul and li ) . Thisca n't happen in JSX because if there is interaction between theelements - there has to be javascript events that bind thecomponents together - every single time you use them . Designers can'tsimply write HTML like syntax - Someone has to step in and put somejavascript bindings in there - which then makes the maintenanceharder . I think the idea makes sense for overriding default behavior , but default behaviors should be supported . And defaults wouldrequire knowing either your parent , or who your owner is ."

"BackgroundI have a pannable app window which works by listening for mousemove events and then using transform : translate3d ( ... ) to move the screen accordingly . It 's a large app and there is considerable UI work associated to facilitate this functionality . Here comes the MCVE , in which the real workload is mocked by a dummy for loop : JSFiddle example with larger drag-areaPlease hold and drag the example.This rudimentary snippet runs a dummy for loop every time mousemove fires , and the duration it takes for the loop to complete is displayed in the draggable container . This is needed to demonstrate the problem below . You may need to adjust the number of iterations , so that the loop takes somewhere above 10ms to run , but not much longer.ProblemThis snippet runs as fast as possible in Google Chrome , no problems there . Untested in Firefox.However , in Microsoft Edge ( and presumably , IE11 as well ) if globalMousemoveHandler runs for longer than about 10ms , the browser starts throttling the event mercillesly , making it fire much less frequently , and obliterating the panning progress down to a crawl.Also quite strange is that the for loop actually runs faster in Microsoft Edge than in Chrome ( almost 50 % faster ) , but the event still fires much less frequently.This is observable in the above snippet when viewed from the mentioned browsers . Now I understand the theoretical desire behind this functionality , but it renders my application unusable on these browsers -- I also do n't really understand what 's the point for the throttling to kick in below 16ms ( I 'm well under the 60 FPS frame budget ) , but that 's besides the question now ( although I 'd be glad to hear some details about this ) .How can I prevent this from happening ?"

I found this but I believe that question is slightly different -- I understand the concept of calling a function on document ready versus one that is globally available ; ( those functions also have names . ) The instructor uses phantom functions ( I think that was the term for a function without a name , ) and when typing out Fig . 2 , he says `` So this will be on document ready ...

"I have a web app that I am trying to speed up . It looks like this : Each box is an iFrame containing a Flash SWF and some javascript . The SWF downloads a thirdparty SWF that is used to display information . I have found that the load time for the webapp is : When I just imbed the 3rd party swf directly ( without our swf or the javascript ) the load time is : I am trying to find where the extra 3 seconds is being used so that I can speed up our webapp . I think that the candidates are : Serverside processing ( jsp ) DownloadJavascriptFlashOther ? DownloadBelow is an image of the downloads taken from firebug . I have replaced the file names with what their type is . None of the downloads are taking especially long after the first time.One place of interest however is marked in red . The red area is a 3 second gap between when My SWF is loaded and when two gif files are loaded followed by the Third Party SWF . I think this pause is caused by processing on the client ( is this true ? ) .Note : The red bars in the graph are not part of the diagram . I added them to highlight the gap where nothing is occurring on the .net panel.I think that I can conclude from this that I have a client side processing issue which implies either Flash or Javascript . Question 1 : Is this correct ? Edit : I added up the total non-concurrent download time : When there is 1 iframes the download time is 1.87 secondsWhen there is 2 iframes the download time is 2.29 secondsWhen there is 5 iframes the download time is 8.57 secondsWhen there is 10 iframes the download time is 10.62 secondsWhen there is 21 iframes the download time is 17.20 secondsJavascriptI used the profiler in firebug to profile the javascript . Here are the results when there are four components on the page : This means that the javascript is running for about .25 second/chart . This seems reasonable to me.Question 2 : Am I reading these results correctly ? This leaves about 3.5 seconds/chart of processing for something else.FlashI inserted some trace statements in the AS3 code . We are listening to an event called something like `` done loading '' . I put a trace in the first initialize method and in the `` done loading '' method . The flash is only eating up .2 second/chart between those two trace statements.Question 3 : Is there a better way to to profile the flash ? Could it be the flash loading or something like that that is eating up the extra time ? OtherI am not sure if there are other things other than : Serverside processing ( jsp ) DownloadJavascriptFlashQuestion 4 : Is there something that I am missing that could be eating up time ? Next StepsI am not sure what my next step should be . I know that something is taking about 1.5 - 3 seconds/chart but I can not figure out what it is . I suspect that it is something related to my swf.Question 5 : How should I find that missing time ? Update : Time SummaryI have graphed all of the times for each thing that could be taking time.The X-axis is the number of charts that are being used.The Y-axis is the about of time loading all of the charts takes.The last graph is possibly the most important graph . The blue dots is the amount of total loading time ( measured using a stop watch ) . The red dots are the amount of time that I have accounted for ( Javascript , download time and flash time ) .Update : Browser WarsI am targeting IE and Firefox ( although it is a nice bonus if other browsers work ) . All of the results presented so far are with Firefox with firebug running . Just for fun I thought I would try in other browsers . I do n't think that this brings me closer to a solution but interesting to see how much IE sucks.Note : Before running tests for Firefox I cleared the cookies and cache . I did not do this for IE or ChromeUpdate : Flash LoadingI have been sprinkling console.log statements though my code trying to sandwich the slow code . ( The results get pushed out to the Firebug console ) .One thing that I have noticed that seems suspicious to me me is that there is a 2.5 second gap between when my last javascript log gets printed and when my first flash log gets printed.Does flash need to setup a virtual machine for each swf ? Does it compile the actionscript on the client ? What happens between when I < embed > my swf and when the creationComplete event in my main .mxml ?"

"I have a simple Chrome extension that uses the chrome.storage API to store tasks in a list . Each time the task list is updated , the array is stored to chrome.storage.sync.I have two laptops set up with the Chrome extension . I 'm logged in to the same Google account on both . Sometimes when I update the task list on the first laptop , the second laptop will reflect the update in a matter of seconds . But other times , the second laptop wo n't receive the updates for a long time . It 's very inconsistent - sometimes if I quit Chrome and restart it on the second machine , the updated list will be there.I 'm not getting any console errors on either laptop , and the tasks are saved correctly on the first machine - they 're just not getting transferred to the second laptop.The chrome.storage.sync API has a few limits and I 'm trying to figure out if I 'm breaching one of them . The likeliest one is this : '' The maximum number of set , remove , or clear operations that can be performed each minute , sustained over 10 minutes . Updates that would cause this limit to be exceeded fail immediately and set runtime.lastError . `` The way I read that , is that as long as there are n't more than 10 operations per minute for 10 consecutive minutes ( at least 100 in total ) , the limit would n't be breached .

"I 'm getting positions every 100ms and apply them to the DOM like this : So the elements get a smooth animation to the new positions in the 100ms it takes to get the next positions .

They are rendered with the same position data , but in a different module of the software.My problem is , that this transition interpolates data that is not available to the other modules .

"So far , there seem to be two opposing solutions to immutability in Javascript : immutable.jsseamless-immutableimmutable.js introduces their own ( shallowly ) immutable objects that are incompatible with the default javascript protocols for objects and arrays.seamless-immutable uses POJOs that are completely immutable without any magic , but do without structural sharing.It would be great to combine the best of both worlds . Could immutable prototype chains/trees be a proper solution ? The underlying prototype mechanism gives hope : Whenever a mutation ( unshift ) of the current instance ( b ) makes it impossible for its prototypes to provide their values , the js engine seems to copy these values straight into the instance automatically . I did n't know that , but it makes total sense.However , working with immutable ( keyed/indexed ) objects one quickly encounters problems : This one is simple : The length property is inherited from the immutable prototype and hence not mutable . Fixing the problem is n't hard : But there will probably be other issues , in particular in more complex , real world scenarios.Maybe someone have already dealt with this idea and can tell me , if it 's worth reasoning about it.Aadit 's answer to a related question and Bergi 's comment on it touches my question without giving an answer ."

I 'm hoping that someone more experienced in JS/JQuery could help me out.Let 's assume I have an separate .js file with 100 JQuery functions inside a document.ready ( ) : I understand that these would now be loaded and ready for every page of the website ( through the inclusion of the .js file ) . However , I could also stick these inside separate document.ready ( ) functions on every individual page of the website , where each page would only get what it actually uses . Or I could craft something even more sophisticated by selectively calling functions that group event handlers inside the document.ready ( ) ; Given that the entire .js file is in any case read by the browser , I would like to know what kind of effect there might be between these approaches on performance . It seems counter-intuitive to load all the event handlers for every page but at the same time this has me wondering whether I 'm creating a problem out of something that actually isn't.A little outside perspective would be useful .

"Given how popular NodeJS is , and how NPM works ... what is the best way to ensure you never install an insecure / malware package ?

Even if I ( as the installer ) reviewed the packages I personally install , I probably would never catch the offending code , especially if the code was obfuscated , like this : This code simply echoes the /etc/passwd file to your standard out . Nothing more . Prove it by running just this : Those of you who catch the eval , good for you !

"I 'm trying to figure out correct approach for a javascript monorepo . Imagine monorepo containing packages / libraries : Now let 's say both lib-a and lib-b packages use webpack as their build tool.I see two approachesAdd wepback as dependency to root . Include `` build '' script in both packages : `` build '' : `` webpack -p -- config webpack.config.js . webpack.config.js could include root webpack.config.js . Then I could use tool like lerna to run the build from root directory ( which means webpack binary is recognized . However I will be unable to run the build in specific packages since webpack is not available there . I could probably change the build script to something like `` build '' : `` ../../node_modules/.bin/webpack -p -- config webpack.config.jsAlways include webpack in each package . This means that build script will succeed . This also means that each package will have the same dependency and I should probably watch that each package uses same webpack version.Basically what I 'm getting at is how should packages inside monorepo be structured ? If any package is published , should it always be possible to build that package separately ."

"I have a utility that draws a simple arc , either using SVG or , as a fallback , Canvas . ( An early version can be found in my Raphael Arcs Project on my website . To accomodate a mobile solution , I recently added code to monitor the size of the container and , if it changes , to re-draw the image to fit the newly sized container . This addition uses only the size of the containing DIV ; the code adds either a SVG or Canvas object to the DIV.Repeatedly reloading the page , however , sometimes the DIV layout is n't ready even when $ ( document ) .ready says it is . This seems to be most prevalent under Chrome ; I 've seen it only once with Opera and never with Firefox 3.6 . The height and width of the containing DIV come back as zero.If you load the link above in Chrome and hit reload , every tenth hit or so the Canvas demo will show a similar flaw : it will be sized width : 100 % of viewport , height : 300px , and the demo will not draw correctly.I 've looked through the jQuery documentation and it seems to insist that $ ( document ) .ready ( ) ought to be enough .

"I have an interface where the user may trigger calls to the same endpoint but with different params ( in this case UUIDs ) . Up until now I 've been enjoying the behavior of switchMap canceling my in-flight http requests whenever I dispatch a new redux action with the same type , and in this case I still want that behavior , but only if the new action 's requested UUID ( part of the action object ) is the same as one that 's already in progress . I 'm not exactly sure of the right approach to this.For example , after dispatching several actions at once , I 'd hope that all of the ones with unique ids complete , but those that repeat an existing and not yet completed id cancel the previous request and take its place.ex : I 've tried using .distinctUntilChanged ( ( a , b ) = > a.uuid === b.uuid ) to filter the stream 's input into .switchMap just to see what would happen , but that merely limits what actions reach the switchMap , and the behavior of canceling all but the most recent GET_SOME_DATA action related API call still occurs.For now , I 'm using mergeMap , but I 'm worried that this could cause issues like I 've run into with live searching where an older request might resolve after the most recent one , causing my redux store to be updated with old data since mergeMap does n't cancel the Observable streams like switchMap does ... is there a way for me to look at current RxJS Ajax requests and cancel those with the new action 's url , or a better solution that I 'm clearly missing ? Cheers ! Edit : I 'm wondering if changing switchMap to mergeMap , then chaining takeUntil and canceling on other GET_SOME_DATA actions would be a proper approach , or if that would just make all requests cancel immediately ? For exampleEdit2 : Apparently the takeUntil addition appears to be working ! I 'm not sure if it 's 100 % on the up and up in terms of being appropriate but I 'd love some feedback . I 'd also like to support a manual cancellation option as well , would the method discussed here be the proper implementation ? Edit3 : I think this is my final , working version . Removed the destructuring of the Redux action in the mergeMap just in case somebody newer to redux-observables comes across this : And the observed network behavior from rapidly clicking everything in sight .

However almost all solutions make use of Math.random , which is not secure.Unfortunately I do not have the reputation to comment/post on that question.Here is the solution I came up with , which uses Durstenfeld shuffling paired with a CSPRNG for generating random integers in a given range ( provided by random-number-csprng lib ) .Is this implementation correct and unbiased ? notes : for my purposes the array would contain at most ~100 elementsrunning nodejs v6.10.3 LTS ( transpiled )"

"So I am trying to use Server Sent Events in my laravel app but the problem is that in SSE , you can only specify single URL as in : The problem is that I want to send events from different parts/controllers of the entire application not just single sse.php file for example .

However , this does n't look like perfect solution . Or maybe hook sse.php file with Laravel events mechanism somehow but that seems kinda advanced.I also do n't mind creating multiple event source objects with different php files like sse.php but problem is that those controllers methods do n't necessarily just send events alone , they do other work as well . For example , I can not use postLogin action directly in SSE object because it also performs the login logic not just sending event.Has anyone had similar problem and how to tackle with it please ?"

"array_map asks for the $ array input as the last parameter ( s ) . array_filter and array_reduce take $ array input as the first parameter . As a contrasting example , when you call map , filter or reduce on an array in JavaScript , the callback function signatures look likeArray.prototype.reduce takes the carryover value as the first parameter , but it is still impossible to mix up the parameters ' order in the JavaScript methods . I know that PHP is n't functionally-oriented , but I 'm wondering what the design decisions were leading to the signatures for array_map etc . Does array_map take an array as the last parameter simply because you can feed as many arrays as you want ( variadic ) ? Does the ability to feed an arbitrary number of arrays through the callback function of array_map outweigh having more uniform function signatures ? EDIT/ Comment : from Wikipedia , this puts in perspective just how long PHP has been evolving : 'Early PHP was not intended to be a new programming language , and grew organically , with Lerdorf noting in retrospect : `` I don ’ t know how to stop it , there was never any intent to write a programming language [ … ] I have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language , I just kept adding the next logical step on the way . '' A development team began to form and , after months of work and beta testing , officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997 . The fact that PHP was not originally designed but instead was developed organically has led to inconsistent naming of functions and inconsistent ordering of their parameters . In some cases , the function names were chosen to match the lower-level libraries which PHP was `` wrapping '' , while in some very early versions of PHP the length of the function names was used internally as a hash function , so names were chosen to improve the distribution of hash values .

Developer coming up to me asking me what I think I 'm doing . He tells me that here , where I work , we do n't create prototypes because they 're evil .

By using $ .formatString ( ... ) instead of `` blah blah '' .formatString ( ... ) , we 're keeping it clear that anything with a $ is not part of native JavaScript.Those reasons seem a bit silly , but I offered a compromise so he would n't have to remember whether a method was an prototype—prefix the prototype function name with $ : That was quickly dismissed and now I 'm having to add these $ .myPrototypeAsAFauxStaticMethodOnjQuery ( ) functions everywhere.Am I the only one that thinks this practice is stupid ?"

I really do n't see the point in involving a third party in this . It seems like updating the type definitions and versioning them is just more complicated this way.Quotes from the documentation referenced above ( emphasis mine ) From DefinitelyTyped : If you are the library author and your package is written in TypeScript , bundle the autogenerated declaration files in your package instead of publishing to Definitely Typed.From typescriptlang.org : Now that you have authored a declaration file following the steps of this guide , it is time to publish it to npm . There are two main ways you can publish your declaration files to npm : bundling with your npm package , orpublishing to the @ types organization on npm.If your package is written in TypeScript then the first approach is favored . Use the -- declaration flag to generate declaration files . This way , your declarations and JavaScript will always be in sync.If your package is not written in TypeScript then the second is the preferred approach.Both seem to say :"

"Here my React component demo : https : //codesandbox.io/s/epic-brown-osiq1 , I am now using the viewBox 's values , getBBox and getBoundingClientRect ( ) to realize some calculations in order to position my element . Currently I have entered raw value based on the return the console have provided me from the getBoundingClientRect ( ) 's logs . You can see it on the element I have implemented the getBoundingClientRect ( ) on , namely the < svg > 's root element and the clip-path 's text 's element . Better but the text is more place tower the center of the screen that really aligned on center of the text 's box-you can see the `` So '' 's word is at the start of the `` Food '' 's word instead of being aligned on the box 's center . So I am at this point currently . Thanks for the feedback . *note : You will see some comments providing information or parts of my former trials inside the sandbox.What my code does ? concretely I display a clip-path 's text with some animated panel travelling the clip-path - this is the color_panel_group 's element- giving some dynamic to the composition.There is also a shadow behind the text to give some depth to the composition.Expectation : display a clip-path 's text responsively positioned at the vertical and horizontal 's centers of the viewport . Problem : My clip-path hides a part of the text and my trials to center the element relative to viewport fails to be fructuous . What I have tried : I have tried to play with the width of the element and the x 's positions of the element -mainly text , clip-path , symbol and both case . Even tried to play with the use element by implementing some class in it , but at the end of the day very approximative result outcomed . Also In tspan and symbol I have tried to play with x 's attribute , again with very approximative outcomes . I have tried to play with position absolute and a relative container -mainly on the SVG 's CSS selector directly- , still with approximative outcomes.I am wondering what I am missing . Maybe someone can bring some explanation on my code 's behavior ? Here my second presentation 's resulting code ( approximately what React component produces ) : Thanks for any hint ."

"This one just stabbed me hard . I do n't know if it 's the case with all browsers ( I do n't have any other competent browser to test with ) , but at least Firefox has two kind of string objects.Open up the Firebugs console and try the following : As you can visually observe , Firefox treats new String ( `` a '' ) and `` a '' differently . Otherwise however , both kinds of strings seem to behave the same . There is , for instance , evidence that both use the same prototype object : So apparently , both are the same . That is , until you ask for the type.We can also notice that when this is a string , it 's always the object form : Going a bit further , we can see that the non-object string representation does n't support any additional properties , but the object string does : Also , fun fact ! You can turn a string object into a non-object string by using the toString ( ) function : Never thought it could be useful to call String.toString ( ) ! Anyways.So all these experiments beg the question : why are there two kinds of strings in JavaScript ? Comments show this is also the case for every primitive JavaScript type ( numbers and bools included ) ."

"I am trying to implement a module for custom errors .

"Update # 2Okay , more testing ensues . It looks like the code works fine when I use a faux spacer , but the regex eventually fails . Specifically , the following scenarios work : Select words above or below the a tagYou select only one line either directly above or below the a tagYou select more than one line above/below the a tagYou select more than one line specifically below any a tagThe following scenarios do not work : You select the line/more lines above the a tag , and then the line/more lines below the a tagWhat happens when it `` does n't work '' is that it removes the a tag spacer from the DOM . This is probably a problem with the regex ... Basically , it fails when you select text around the a tag.Update : I do n't need to wrap each line in a p tag , I can instead use an inline element , such as an a , span , or label tag , with display : inline-block and a height + width to act as a new line element ( < br / > ) . This should make it easier to modify the code , as the only part that should have to change is where I get the text in between the bounds . I should only have to change that part , selectedText.textContent , to retrieve the HTML that is also within the bounds instead of just the text.I am creating a Phonegap that requires the user to select text . I need fine control over the text selection , however , and can no longer plop the entire text content in a pre styled p tag . Instead , I need represent a linebreak with something like < a class= '' space '' > < /a > , so that the correct words can be highlighted precisely . When my text looks like this : And has .text { white-space : pre-wrap } , the following code allows me to select words , then wrap the text with span elements to show that the text is highlighted : This code works beautifully , but not when each line is separated by a spacer tag . The new text looks like this : When I modify the above code to work with have new lines represented by < a class= '' space '' > < /a > , the code fails . It only retrieves the text of the selection , and not the HTML ( selectedText.textContent ) . I 'm not sure if the regex will also fail with an a element acting as a new line either . The a element could be a span or label , or any normally inline positioned element , to trick iOS into allowing me to select letters instead of block elements.Is there anyway to change the code to preserve the new line elements ? jsFiddle : http : //jsfiddle.net/charlescarver/39TZ9/3/The desired output should look like this : If the text `` Line one '' was highlighted : If the text `` Line one Line two '' was highlighted : Of course different parts and individual letters can and will be highlighted as well instead of full lines ."

"Programming is about making decisions about how to implement any piece of code . Depending of such decisions , the code will be more or less readable , efficient , complex , etc . A common decision is also about to do it more or less idiomatic , that is , using specific statements or your programming language or paradigm.As a proof of concept I have developed two code snippets , in Javascript , to analyze the performance . The goal is to generate a string in the form tagA|tagB|tagC where then number of tagX is random and the suffixes A , B , C are random integers . Moreover , tagX can not be repeated.First implementation is more idiomatic , whereas the second one is more traditional . Next the code snippets of each one : Idiomatic : TraditionalTo measure the performance I have used the Performance Timing APIThe results are a bit surpraising , at least for me . Note how the traditional way is so much efficient than the other one.I have repeated the experiment several times with similar resultsIdiomatic way looks pretty cool and shorter , but it is less efficient and hard to read.What do you think about it ? Does it worth using idiomatic programming instead of traditional ? Is there a general answer or it is strongly dependent of each case ? What about code readability and complexity ?

I am struggling with understanding how this snippet works on a basic levelPlease help me understand where i got it wrong .

"The question is simple ; using jQuery 's css function , the computed style of a CSS attribute may be returned , but what if there are more than one style for that attribute being rendered ? For example : The instruction $ ( ' # foo ' ) .css ( 'text-decoration ' ) ; will return underline . Now if I change it toThe instruction $ ( ' # bar ' ) .css ( 'text-decoration ' ) ; will return line-through , alright.But the actual text is also underline ! How can I return both ? Do I need to search all ancestors if I want to know if some text is both underline and line-through ? Sounds a bit painful , no ? ** Edit **Another problem arises whith this HTMLwhere $ ( ' # e1 ' ) .css ( 'text-decoration ' ) ; returns none for some reason , while the text is clearly rendered with an underline . ** Disclaimer **This question is not to debate how the UA renders an element , but if an element hierarchy applies a CSS or not .

"tl ; dr : YouTube embedded video < iframe > tags have touch-event-listeners . Active touch-event listeners cause scroll performance issues - AKA jank . I usually manage to fix active touch-event related jank issues by using touch-action : initial in CSS . This does not work for Youtube embedded video < iframe > elements.Intro : Kayce Basques - Google techie - writes : When you scroll a page and there 's such a delay that the page does n't feel anchored to your finger , that 's called scroll jank . Many times when you encounter scroll jank , the culprit is a touch event listener . Touch event listeners are often useful for tracking user interactions and creating custom scroll experiences , such as cancelling the scroll altogether when interacting with an embedded Google Map . Currently , browsers ca n't know if a touch event listener is going to cancel the scroll , so they always wait for the listener to finish before scrolling the page.I have found a way to sidestep this with CSS using touch-action The touch-action CSS property specifies whether , and in what ways , a given region can be manipulated by the user via a touchscreen ( for instance , by panning or zooming features built into the browser ) .If I use touch-action : initial the problem disappears . If you want to see what causes scroll jank and what does not , examine the screenshot belowRed buttons cause jank while green ones do n't . The only differece between the two is that red buttons are set to touch-action : manipulation which makes red buttons actively `` listen '' and process input before scrolling can proceedThe issueI embed videos from Youtube . The iframes contain touch event listeners that are active . The method I mentioned above does not work . I do n't have access to Youtube code to edit the listeners and set them to passive.I have tried to narrow down the issue . I have found that the element with the class .html5-video-player has the following CSSAccording to the docs , manipulation can [ ... ] Enable panning and pinch zoom gestures , but disable additional non-standard gestures such as double-tap to zoom . Disabling double-tap to zoom removes the need for browsers to delay the generation of click events when the user taps the screen . This is an alias for `` pan-x pan-y pinch-zoom '' ( which , for compatibility , is itself still valid ) .and [ ... ] is also often used to completely disable the delay of click events caused by support for the double-tap to zoom gesture.All of which are things I do n't need.Logic says all I need to do is add this to my CSSbut that does n't work , nor does this : or this : or even this : Even if I try a different approach like : It still does not work .

"I 'm finding myself a bit lost amongst the many many sign and domain conventions used in webGl . Take a gander at this regl example ( it shows the baboon test image ) .

Drawing this out on paper , it appears this was chosen specifically because it encompasses the region [ 0,1 ] x [ 0,1 ] .uv takes its values from world space , including this [ 0,1 ] x [ 0,1 ] region ( which is the domain of texture2d ) . If I understand correctly , the convention is that +u points towards the right edge of the image , +v points towards the top.gl_Position is set to 1 - 2*uv , so that the image occupies [ -1,1 ] x [ -1,1 ] , z=0 in `` clip space , '' whatever that is.More importantly , it also means that the + { u , v } directions correspond to - { x , y } ! The displayed image , is , in fact , mirrored horizontally ! ! ( compare to this ) But it is not mirrored vertically . There must be something else along the eventual conversion to/from onscreen pixel coordinates that cancels out the negative factor in y.However , Google searches bring up no evidence that gl_Position is mirrored in any way relative to the screen . I see discussion that it is left-handed , but that is simply from negating z relative to world coordinates . ( e.g . this question here ) In brief , it appears to me that this image ought to be mirrored vertically as well.What am I missing ? For posterity , the code is reproduced below : ( MIT licensed )"

"Apparently I did not yet understand the mechanic behind ng-repeat , $ $ hashKeys and track by.I am currently using AngularJS 1.6 in my project . The Problem : I got an array of complex objects which i want to use to render a list in my view . But to get the required result i need to modify ( or map/enhance/change ) these objects first : Binding this to the view should be working like this : However this obviously runs into a $ digest ( ) -loop , because .map returns new object-instances every time it is called . Since I bind this to ng-repeat via a function , it gets reevaluated in every $ digest , the model does not stabilize and Angular keeps rerunning $ digest-cycles because these objects are flagged as $ dirty.Why i am confusedNow this is not a new issue and there are several solutions for this : In an Angular-Issue from 2012 Igor Minar himself suggested to set the $ $ hashKey-Property manually to tell angular that the generated objects are the same . This is his working fiddle , but since even this very trivial example still ran into a $ digest-loop when i used it in my project , i tried upgrading the Angular-Version in the fiddle . For some reason it crashes.Okay ... since Angular 1.3 we have track by which should essentially solve this exact problem . However both andcrash with a $ digest-loop . I was under the impression that the track by statement should let angular believe it works with the same objects , but apparently this is not the case since it just keeps checking them for changes . To be honest , i have no idea how i can properly debug the cause of this.Question : Is it possible to use a filtered/ modified array as data-source for ng-repeat ? I do not want to store the modified array on my controller , because i need to update its data constantly and would then have to maintain and refresh it manually in the controller instead of relying on databinding ."
"Ca n't figure out why disposing computed observables does n't remove the subscriptions from global variables in case view model was created using knockout.mapping plugin.First let 's see what happens when model is created directly : I used Chrome dev tools to record heap allocations while adding and removing items several times .

"I have a function F that starts an asynchronous process X . The function returns a promise that is resolved when X ends ( which I learn by means of a promise returned by X ) .While the ( w.l.o.g . ) first instance of X , X1 , is running , there may be more calls to F. Each of these will spawn a new instance of X , e.g . X2 , X3 , and so on.Now , here 's the difficulty : When X2 is created , depending on the state of X1 , X1 should conclude or be aborted . X2 should start working only once X1 is not active any more . In any case , the unresolved promises returned from all previous calls to F should be resolved only once X2 has concluded , as well - or , any later instance of X , if F gets called again while X2 is running.So far , the first call to F invokes $ q.defer ( ) to created a deferred whose promise is returned by all calls to F until the last X has concluded . ( Then , the deferred should be resolved and the field holding it should be reset to null , waiting for the next cluster of calls to F. ) Now , my issue is waiting until all instances of X have finished . I know that I could use $ q.all if I had the full list of X instances beforehand , but as I have to consider later calls to F , this is not a solution here . Ideally , I should probably then-chain something to the promise returned by X to resolve the deferred , and `` unchain '' that function as soon as I chain it to a later instance of X.I imagine that something like this : However , I do n't know how to perform that `` unchaining '' , if that is even the right solution.How do I go about this ? Am I missing some common pattern or even built-in feature of promises , or am I on the wrong track altogether ? To add a little context : F is called to load data ( asynchronously ) and updating some visual output . F returns a promise that should only be resolved once the visual output is updated to a stable state again ( i.e . with no more updates pending ) ."

It just disappears silently.Here 's sample code to recreate the problem : As you can see from the comments , it only seems to happen in this particular sequence of events . Removing a stage , or swapping a Parse promise for a native JS promise , causes things to behave again . ( In my actual code , the `` Promise.resolve ( ) '' stage is actually a call into a native iOS method that returns a promise . ) I 'm aware that Parse promises do n't behave exactly like A+ compliant promises ( cf . https : //stackoverflow.com/a/31223217/2397068 ) . Indeed , calling Parse.Promise.enableAPlusCompliant ( ) before this section of code causes the exception to be caught and printed . But I thought that Parse promises and native JS promises could be used together safely.Why is this exception disappearing silently ? Thank you ."
"I have a React app ( using React Create App ) which I want to upload to production using a script . My production is an AWS S3 bucket . I have added to package.json a `` deploy '' script as follows : This will updload all the build files to the production bucket . Since the build static files ( css , js etc . ) get their own hash code they do not get overwritten by each version and that is fine . The problem I am having is that I do n't want the index.html file to be uploaded until AFTER the other files have completed upload . That way , once index.html is overwritten with the latest version the new static files are automatically used . Any idea how to achieve this ? If there is a better script for uploading a react app to S3 would be great ."
"Angular JS DependenciesAre there any commonly accepted conventions for how to format long lists of dependencies when using inline bracket notation ? After browsing through github and the Angular JS Developer Guide , I have n't seen a consistent approach.I 'm not interested in what individuals think is best ( sorry ) , but if there are standard conventions or best practices defined somewhere that I ca n't find.ExamplesStandardThis is valid , but it extends to column 212 . It 's also difficult to quickly compare the strings and the arguments.Somewhat betterIt 's still out to column 87 , but it 's easy to compare the strings and args.Functional , but a little weird.I 'm inclined to use this one , since it 's compact horizontally and allows for quickly commenting out dependencies .

"When I click on the search icon the event fires as it should . But when the search box is expanded the click does n't fire , instead , the search box goes back to being small again.Edit : See claudios snippet for the behaviour I meanEdit 2 : .mouseDown ( ) instead of .click ( ) works . So it seems that when I click on the search icon , focus in the searchbox is lost which makes it go back to it 's original size . This would appear to happen before the mouseUp event which means the coords for the search icon are no longer the same as the .click ( ) event .

"I 'm developing an app that deals with pictures and using parse.com services as a backend . At some point I had to choose between : store different versions of the same picture , e.g . 100x100 for thumbnails , 400x400 for bigger views , 1000x1000 for fullscreen views ; store only the 1000x1000 version , and scale it down when needed , possibly server-side.The solution I 'm currently working on is a mixture of the two : I hold 100x100 for thumbnails , 1000x1000 for fullscreen views and would like to scale it down for any other need . I started working on a Cloud Code function to achieve this . My wish is to pass to the function the width of the current view , so to make the image adaptable to the client 's need . I have two questions : is this approach correct , or should I better simply store a middle-sized version of the image ( like 400x400 ) ? Would this determine too many calls to the cloud code function ?

I ca n't seem to get any import to work when the module is n't defined as a string . What is going on ? test.tsDoes not work : backbone.d.tsWorks : backbone.d.tsEdit 1 : FYI From 10.1.4 An AmbientModuleIdentification with a StringLiteral declares an external module . This type of declaration is permitted only in the global module . The StringLiteral must specify a top-level external module name . Relative external module names are not permittedI do n't understand how it 's useful to not specify it as the string literal format as found here and here . It works if you use /// < reference ... without a string literal module but I 'm trying to generate AMD modules that depend on these libraries so I need the import to work . Am I the minority and I have to go and modify each .d.ts to be the string literal version ? Edit 2 : Declaring a module using a string literal requires that your import is an exact match if that string literal . You can no longer use relative or absolute paths to the location of this module/module definition even if it is not located in the same directory as the file trying to import it . This makes it that a /// < reference and an import are required but produces a module with tsc -- module AMD that was exactly looking for ( path to module is as dictated by the module string literal `` Backbone '' ) .For example.backbone.d.ts : Works : test.ts : Does not work : test.ts : Note that this works as well ...

This behaviour has been tested in chrome/FF/safari/IEEDITAs pointed out by mishik , this is due to how jQuery handles script tags , using the globalEval method to run scripts in the global context . So a possible workaround for using jQuery ( but not fall back to the pure JavaScript method ) could be to set the newwindow variable in the global context too and use it like that , e.g : DEMO"

"In IndexedDB , there are two ways to update an object already in the database .

"My company uses Keycloak for authentication connected with LDAP and returning a user object filled with corporative data.Yet in this period we are all working from home and in my daily work having to authenticate in my corporative server every time I reload the app , has proven to be an expensive overhead . Especially with intermittent internet connections . How can I fake the Keycloak call and make keycloak.protect ( ) work as it has succeeded ? I can install a Keyclock server in my machine , but I 'd rather not do that because it would be another server running in it besides , vagrant VM , Postgres server , be server , and all the other things I leave open.It would be best to make a mock call and return a fixed hard-coded object . My project 's app-init.ts is this : I just need one fixed logged user . But it has to return some fixed customized data with it . Something like this : EDITI tried to look at the idea of @ BojanKogoj but AFAIU from Angular Interceptor page and other examples and tutorials , it has to be injected in a component . Keycloak initialization is called on app initialization , not in a component . Also Keycloak 's return is not the direct return of init ( ) method . It passes through other objects in the .getKeycloakInstance ( ) .loadUserInfo ( ) .success ( ) sequence.Or maybe it 's just me that did n't fully understand it . If anyone can come with an example of an interceptor that can intercept the call and return the correct result , that could be a possibility.Edit2Just to complement that what I need is for the whole keycloak 's system to work . Please notice that the ( user : KeycloakUser ) = > { function is passed to success method of keycloak 's internal system . As I said above , routes have a keycloak.protect ( ) that must work . So it 's not just a simple case of returning a promise with a user . The whole .getKeycloakInstance ( ) .loadUserInfo ( ) .success ( ) chain has to be mocked .

"I learned react and Redux at the same time and went `` all in '' on Redux ; basically all state is stored in Redux . And I followed the standard allIds , byId state shape pattern as detailed here . My app is very data-centric , it talks to an API , and does alot of CRUD type actions - fetchAll , fetchById , add , update , delete . The API communication is segregated into a `` service layer '' module that is its own npm package . All calls to this service layer are in the Redux actions , using redux-thunk.I 've realized there is no need to put most everything in Redux , the data is really needed on a specific component , for example . And I would love to simplify this architecture.So I began to refactor into a custom hook instead . It seemed since my state shape was more of an object rather than scalar , I should use useReducer rather than useState ... When I got to setting the state in the reducer for the update action , I realized it would be easier if I used `` allIds '' and `` byId '' pattern . And at this point I thought - how is this any different than using Redux ? It is going to end up looking like almost the exact same code , and I 'm losing some power of selectors , but removing the complexity of redux-thunks . And my current redux actions include specific use case actions ( special save for item type X , for ex . ) so I 'd need to find a place for those.My question is - is there any reason to refactor this to a hook using local state ?"
"I have a simple ajax call like this : It is part of an tb autocomplete that does not work on only one view . The reason it does not work is that instead of json , it makes jsonp request ( by sniffing I saw that it calls passed url with ? callback=jQueryxxxxxxxxx ) , and success function is never called because jquery packs it into anonymous function whose name is passed in callback argument , and server returns standard json ( I do n't want to use jsonp as it is POST request and NOT cross-domain request ) . I checked , both current view url and this u for ajax url argument are on http : //localhost:8080/myapp/areax/ ... , so I do n't see why jQuery makes JSONP request here.EDIT : View on which this does not work has url request is made is like this : http : //hostname:8080/AreaName/Report/ViewReportand u parameter of ajax is like /AreaName/MyAutoComplete/Search , so complete url to which autocomplete is made is likehttp : //hostname:8080/AreaName/MyAutoComplete/Search ? callback=jQuery151013129048690121925_1327065146844Server 's response looks like this : I know it is not jsonp , for that it should beBut I want to make normal json request , not jsonp.UPDATEWeirdest thing of all ( I 'm starting to think it is a bug in jQUery v1.5.1 which is used on project ) is that when I remove dataType : `` json '' , it makes a normal json request : ) So , instead of how to make json request , now I will accept an explanation to why this works as expected ( and the one with dataType : '' json '' does not ) :"

First post but thanks everyone for all the info ! On to the issue . I have some code in which I am trying to iterate over a JSON file and execute an HTTP Get Request on each object in the array . The issue seems to arise in that when I am executing the http get request that it does not do so in order nor does it complete . It hangs up after about 6-9 calls against my API.Sample JSON : Iterating over the JSON : Copy of the function I am executing on each loop for the API call . I have a callback set but I do n't think I may have set this up properly : Sample of my console log where it hangs up : Anything you think I can improve on in the code that would be great..

"the following code illustrate the problem , changing the order of Read/Write causes a big difference in execution time ( Tested using Chrome , Firefox and IE ) : Here 's a JSFiddle for the complete example http : //jsfiddle.net/Dq3KZ/2/ .My results for n=100 : Slow version : ~35msFast version : ~2msfor n=1000 : Slow version : ~2000msFast version : ~25msI think this is related with the number of browser reflow in each case . In the slow scenario , a reflow happens for each write operation . However , in the fast scenario , the reflow occurs only once at the end . But I 'm not sure and I do n't understand why it does work that way ( when the operations are independent ) .Edit : I used InnerText property instead of clientWidth and Style.Width , I got the same behavior when using Google Chrome ( http : //jsfiddle.net/pindexis/CW2BF/7/ ) . However , when InnerHTML is used , there 's almost no difference ( http : //jsfiddle.net/pindexis/8E5Yj/ ) .

"I have been using Google Analytics for basic analytics for my web app - just tracking page impressions using javascript calls like this : This approach has always frustrated me because I could n't reliably capture some server-side events . I have just discovered I can use Measurement Protocol to record events server-side . Recording the events on my server looks easy , except regarding the cid ( clientid ) parameter ... What I understand is that on the browser , with the javascript I currently have the cid gets randomly created and then stored in the _ga cookie . I also understand that I should share that clientid/cid value between client ( 'page view ' ) and server ( other events ) calls for the same client so that they are correlated together.This StackOverflow link was a helpful reference for me.Question is : should ICreate a clientid on the server and then share it with the client ; orShould I let the javascript on the client create the clientid and then try to share it with my server ? ( I suspect this is the better answer ) For ( 1 ) , what I was thinking I could do is : Store a UUID in the session on the server ( which is google app engine ) Directly use that UUID when I use Measurement Protocol to create events directly server-sideUse the same UUID when I create a ga object on a page using jsp : The thing that worries me about this approach is that the ID will only persist across the session on the server . I think the intent of the clientId ( cid ) is that it persists for the client over an extended period ... So I think I will lose track of who is new versus returning user ? For ( 2 ) , frankly I do n't know how to do this ... I know from the above StackOverflow link that I can get the cid out of the clientId parameters in the ga object .

"How can I efficiently send a list of arguments into an Emscripten Web Worker from native JavaScript ?

"I have an ASP.NET page that contains two div 's . Both have search fields and a search button contained within each of them . When I first come to this page , Div A has the class 'SearchDiv ' while Div B has 'SearchDivDisabled ' . These classes change the appearance so the user knows which search type they currently have enabled . When Div B is clicked , JavaScript changes it 's class to 'SearchDiv ' , and changes Div A to 'SearchDivDisabled ' . This all works like a charm . The problem I have is when a user changes to Div B , clicks Div B 's search button ( which obviously redirects to a results page ) , and then uses the browser 's back button . When they return to the search page , Div A is enabled again , and Div B is Disabled , even though they last used Div B . In the search button event handler I set the class attribute of the Divs before I redirect , hoping this will update the page on the server so when the user returns , their last-enabled Div will still be enabled ( regardless of which one was enabled when the page was first visited ) .I believe this involves the ViewState , but I 'm unsure why the class attribute is not saved so when the user returns to the page it is restored . Is there something I 'm missing here , or some easy way to guarantee the behavior I want ? Thanks ! Edit : Here is the button event handler code : RedirectToResults ( ) is called from the actual button event handler with the enum representing the selected search panel and the results page url . SearchContainers is a dictionary mapping an integer to the search Div . The important code is the last line , where I 'm updating the selected search container with the 'active ' search class , rather than the disabled one ( which I assign to the other div ( s ) ) Additional Update : I have been battling with this issue for the last couple days . I was sort of able to get the following code to work ( in page_load ) : But this really is n't a solution , as everything else that gets cached correctly is lost , which leaves me worse off than when I started . Everything else seems to persist fine , it is just the class of the div that is causing me struggles . Edit : Just wanted to update this for anyone else that comes across this . While I believe there is a solution here with setting the cacheability of the page to force the browser to postback , I could not get it working 100 % with all browsers ( primarily Firefox was giving me fits , which is a documented bug ) . I do believe the cookie solution would work , but I felt that may be a bit more complex than necessary for just trying to store the state of a couple div 's . What I ended up doing was tying the div 's class to the state of it 's correlating radio button ( there are radio buttons next to the div which allow the users a more visual way of enabling search panels ) . I noticed these radio buttons retained the correct checked value when the back button was used , so I could guarantee they would indicate the correct div to be enabled . So in JavaScript 's onload I check which radio button is enabled , and then adjust the classes of the search div 's accordingly . This is a pretty big hack , but has worked 100 % across all browsers , and only took about 10 lines of JavaScript ."

"I have a simple script that adds and removes padding-left to textareas/inputs on focus/blur , respectively . This is to make room for a small , absolutely-positioned button on the left side of the field , without blocking the text underneath it . [ Edit ] It simultaneously changes the width of the element as well , to keep the total size of the block consistent.In almost all browsers this works fine and dandy , except MSIE 9 . [ Edit ] Although the box stays the same size , indicating the CSS for both properties was properly updated , the text in the input/textarea behaves as though the padding has not changed . I know the callbacks for the focus/blur events are firing and updating the DOM object 's style properties properly , because fetching the current value of the property always gives you the value expected.i.e.Yet the text in the input/textarea field still shows the previous padding . Basically , something seems to be confusing MSIE9 's rendering engine in the context these fields appear when you try to change width and padding at the same time.As soon as you start typing in the field MSIE will fix the problem and make the text in the input/textarea obey the current padding . Realizing this , I tried adding a field.val ( field.val ( ) ) ; to the end of the blur and focus callbacks . This solves one problem , and introduces another in the form of resetting the caret position to the beginning of the input/textarea.Is there any way to force a browser to redraw a given element without going through the drama of removing and reinserting it into the DOM ? [ EDIT ] Here is a fiddle showing an abbreviated form of the code ( which has additional functionality in its actual context ) : http : //jsfiddle.net/KYrXM/You will see that the padding is updated , but no visible change is made until AFTER you start typing.This problem goes away if I choose not to change the width property as well , though I need to in order to keep the box size constant in my application ."

Obviously one would expect all the buttons to alert it 's own text when clicked , but instead all the buttons alert the text of the final index in the map.maps object when clicked.I assume this behavior is caused by the neat way JavaScript handles closures , going back and executing functions from the closures in which they were created.The only way I can imagine getting around this is setting the index as data on the button object and using it from the click callback .

"I 'm trying to understand how jQuery creates the return object when searching for DOM elements . I 've gone through the source , but I 'm not completely sure I understand , and was hoping somebody here could give me some insight . From what I can gather reading the source , when querying for a jQuery DOM , jQuery finds matching DOM elements , and then adds the matched DOM element as an object using the index of the element as the key for the new object . Returning this , is returning the entire jQuery object which includes all the methods . Have I got it right to this point ? Now , it appears all the functions like css , find , ajax , hide , etc . are in the jQuery.fn object . Somehow ( and I think this is where I 'm not seeing it ) , these functions are called , not on the DOM element itself , but through the access.js https : //github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core/access.jsusing css as an example , we haveWhat I think I 'm missing is how did we get from calling $ ( 'div ' ) .css ( ... ) to that calling the jQuery.fn.extend.css method , and from there , the access method being called with a different signature to the access method initialized in the core jQuery ?

Secondly , although it looks from the console output ( below ) that I 'm getting meaningful values out of the calls to SHGetSpecialFolderLocation and SHChangeNotifyRegister ( the return values are n't errors and the PIDLISTITEM pointer is some real address ) I 'm not getting Device/Drive messages in the JavaScript callback . Also , I tried to reproduce the PIDLISTITEM structures to no avail ( could n't get js-ctypes to recognise them in calls to SHChangeNotifyRegister ) and after studying some other non C++ examples , it seems that most folks are just using long* instead -- I hope that 's the source of my misunderstanding ! I 've verified via similar C++ sample project from Microsoft that the messages themselves are received when the SHChangeNotifyRegistration succeeds and I generate USB media events ( ny inserting & removing USB flash media ) .

"Say we 're writing a browser app where smooth animation is critical . We know garbage collection can block execution long enough to cause a perceptible freeze , so we need to minimize the amount of garbage we create . To minimize garbage , we need to avoid memory allocation while the main animation loop is running.But that execution path is strewn with loops : And their var statements allocate memory can allocate memory that the garbage collector may remove , which we want to avoid.So , what is a good strategy for writing loop constructs in JavaScript that avoid allocating memory each one ? I 'm looking for a general solution , with pros and cons listed.Here are three ideas I 've come up with:1 . ) Declare `` top-level '' vars for index and length ; reuse them everywhereWe could declare app.i and app.length at the top , and reuse them again and again : Pros : Simple enough to implement . Cons : Performance hit by dereferencing the properties might mean a Pyrrhic victory . Might accidentally misuse/clobber properties and cause bugs.2 . ) If array length is known , do n't loop -- unrollWe might be guaranteed that an array has a certain number of elements . If we do know what the length will be in advance , we could manually unwind the loop in our program : Pros : Efficient . Cons : Rarely possible in practice . Ugly ? Annoying to change ? 3 . ) Leverage closures , via the factory patternWrite a factory function that returns a 'looper ' , a function that performs an action on the elements of a collection ( a la _.each ) . The looper keeps private reference to index and length variables in the closure that is created . The looper must reset i and length each time it 's called.Pros : More functional , more idiomatic ?

"In trying to learn JavaScript closures , I 've confused myself a bit.From what I 've gathered over the web , a closure is ...

It allows text in a div to be scrolled up and down by buttons.Does this example use closures ?

"I seem to often end up in a situation where I am rendering a view , but the Model on which that view depends is not yet loaded . Most often , I have just the model 's ID taken from the URL , e.g . for a hypothetical market application , a user lands on the app with that URL : http : //example.org/ # /products/product0In my ProductView , I create a ProductModel and set its id , product0 and then I fetch ( ) . I render once with placeholders , and when the fetch completes , I re-render . But I 'm hoping there 's a better way.Waiting for the model to load before rendering anything feels unresponsive . Re-rendering causes flickering , and adding `` loading ... please wait '' or spinners everywhere makes the view templates very complicated ( esp . if the model fetch fails because the model does n't exist , or the user is n't authorized to view the page ) .So , what is the proper way to render a view when you do n't yet have the model ? Do I need to step awayfrom hashtag-views and use pushState ? Can the server give me a push ? I 'm all ears.Loading from an already-loaded page : I feel there 's more you can do when there 's already a page loaded as opposed to landing straight on the Product page . If the app renders a link to a Product page , say by rendering a ProductOrder collection , is there something more that can be done ? My natural way to handle this link-to-details-page pattern is to define a route which does something along these lines : I tend to then call fetch ( ) inside the view 's initialize function , and call this.render ( ) from an this.listenTo ( 'change ' , ... ) event listener . This leads to complicated render ( ) cases , and objects appearing and disappearing from view . For instance , my view template for a Product might reserve some screen real-estate for user comments , but if and only if comments are present/enabled on the product -- and that is generally not known before the model is completely fetched from the server.Now , where/when is it best to do the fetch ? If I load the model before the page transition , it leads to straightforward view code , but introduces delays perceptible to the user . The user would click on an item in the list , and would have to wait ( without the page changing ) for the model to be returned . Response times are important , and I have n't done a usability study on this , but I think users are used to see pages change immediately as soon as they click a link.If I load the model inside the ProductView 's initialize , with this.model.fetch ( ) and listen for model events , I am forced to render twice , -- once before with empty placeholders ( because otherwise you have to stare at a white page ) , and once after . If an error occurs during loading , then I have to wipe the view ( which appears flickery/glitchy ) and show some error.Is there another option I am not seeing , perhaps involving a transitional loading page that can be reused between views ? Or is good practice to always make the first call to render ( ) display some spinners/loading indicators ? Edit : Loading via collection.fetch ( ) One may suggest that because the items are already part of the collection listed ( the collection used to render the list of links ) , they could be fetched before the link is clicked , with collection.fetch ( ) . If the collection was indeed a collection of Product , then it would be easy to render the product view.The Collection used to generate the list may not be a ProductCollection however . It may be a ProductOrderCollection or something else that simply has a reference to a product id ( or some sufficient amount of product information to render a link to it ) .Fetching all Product via a collection.fetch ( ) may also be prohibitive if the Product model is big , esp . in the off-chance that one of the product links gets clicked.The chicken or the egg ? The collection.fetch ( ) approach also does n't really solve the problem for users that navigate directly to a product page ... in this case we still need to render a ProductView page that requires a Product model to be fetched from just an id ( or whatever 's in the product page URL ) ."

"I 'm having a little difficulty with the inherent concept of a closure . I get the basic idea , but here 's the thing : I thought that , technically , there `` is a closure '' inside every Javascript function . To quote wikipedia : In computer science , a closure ( also lexical closure , function closureor function value ) is a function together with a referencingenvironment for the nonlocal names ( free variables ) of that function.Such a function is said to be `` closed over '' its free variables.So since you can define variables inside a function , they are `` closed off '' to the rest of your code , and so I see that as a closure . Thus , as I understand it : Is a ( not very useful ) example of a closure . Or heck , even just this : But , I think my understanding might be wrong . Others are telling me that for something to be a closure it has to persist a state , and so since nothing persists beyond that code it 's not really a closure . That suggests that you need to have : or even ( to ensure un-modifiability ) : So , technically speaking ( I know several of the examples are practically speaking pointless , but ) which of the above examples are actually examples of closures . And does a closure just have to be a space ( ie . inside a JS function ) where variables can be stored that ca n't be accessed form outside , or is persistence a key part of a closure 's definition ? EDITJust noticed the wiki definition for the `` closures '' tag on Stack Overflow : A closure is a first-class function that refers to ( closes over ) variables from the scope in which it was defined . If the closure stillexists after its defining scope ends , the variables it closes overwill continue to exist as well.While the SO wiki is certainly no final authority , the first sentence does seem to correlate with my understanding of the term . The second sentence then suggests how a closure can be used , but it does n't seem like a requirement.EDIT # 2In case it is n't clear from the varying answers here , the wikipedia answer , and the tag answer , there does not seem to be a clear consensus on what the word `` closure '' even means . So while I appreciate all the answers so far , and they all make sense if you go with the author 's definition of closure , what I guess I 'm really looking for is ... is there any actual `` authoritative '' definition of the word ( and then if so , how does it apply to all of the above ) ?"
"The Story and Motivation : We have a rather huge end-to-end Protractor test codebase . Sometimes it happens that a test waits for a specific fix to be implemented - usually as a part of a TDD approach and to demonstrate how a problem is reproduced and what is the intended behavior . What we are currently doing is using Jasmine 's pending ( ) with a Jira issue number inside . Example : Now , we 'd like to know when we can rename the pending ( ) back to it ( ) and run the test . Or , in other words , when the issue AP-1234 is resolved or sent to testing . The Current Approach : At the moment , I 'm trying to solve it with a custom ESLint rule , jira NodeJS module , and Q . The custom ESLint rule searches for pending ( ) calls with at least one argument . Extracts the ticket numbers in format of AP- followed by 4 digits and uses jira.findIssue ( ) to check its status in Jira . If status is Resolved - report an error.Here is what I 've got so far : Where getTicket ( ) is defined as : The problem is : currently , it successfully extracts the ticket numbers from the pending ( ) calls , but does n't print ticket statuses . No errors though.The Question : The general question is , I guess , would be : can I use asynchronous code blocks , wait for callbacks , resolve promises in custom ESLint rules ? And , if not , what are my options ? A more specific question would be : what am I doing wrong and how can I use Node.js jira module with ESLint ?

"I ’ ve been writing unit tests in strongly typed languages and I have a fair good understanding about it .

"So I finished reading this article which basically talks about how v8 and other javascript engines internally cache the `` shape '' of objects so that when they need to repeatedly access a particular property on an object , they can just use the direct memory address instead of looking up where in that object 's memory that particular property is.That got me thinking , in React you often declare a component 's state inside the constructor but do n't include all the properties that will eventually be included in the state , for example : Since according to the article , the state object does n't remain a consistent structure , would doing something like this be less efficient than defining all the possible state 's fields in the constructor ? Should you always at least add all the properties even giving them a value of null so that the object is always consistent ? Will it impact performance in any substantial way ?"

"Some days ago I 've started developing an animated odometer written in HTML and javascript , which I intend to use on a rpg game that I am developing . Also , I 've been using Pixi.js to help me on the animations . The 2 following images are the main components of the program : odometerrow of numbers : And here is a print of what I 've accomplished so far : Basically , the first two buttons update instantly ( with no animation ) the numbers on the odometer image , based the actual HP and PP values contained in the actual HP and PP textboxes . If the 'Set New Values ' is pressed , it will calculate the difference between the actual and new values , convert it to pixels and then perform the needed changes on the odometer . All the changes are performed by a controller ( ) method . Inside this method , there is a while loop that will break when both HP and PP difference values are zero.I 've managed to program the controller ( ) method correctly , so all the numbers in the odometer are updated as expected . However , I am currently facing some difficulties in implementing the animations . Since I 've been using Pixi.js , I 've added the following method to the HTML code in order to create the animations ' movements : The container is defined as shown below ( I am also using a PIXI.extras.TilingSprite.call ( ) inside the construction class of both Odometer and HPPP ) : Until now , I 've experienced 2 scenarios : The first one ( where onClick=controller ( ) , for the 'Set New Value ' button ) , if the code is executed with no modifications , the program will run and the odometer numbers will update instantly , which means that there will be no animation.However , if the controller ( ) method is added in the beginning of the update ( ) method , the numbers will animate very rapidly , but the limits defined by the difference values will not be obeyed ( which means that it will animate indefinitely from 000 to 999 ) .I am still really fresh on HTML and javascript development , and I do n't even know if Pixi.js would be the best choice for this . Anyway , is it possible to perform smooth and controlled animations for this odometer ?

"A friend of mine and I were having a discussion regarding currying and partial function application in Javascript , and we came to very different conclusions as to whether either were achievable . I came up with this implementation of Function.prototype.curry , which was the basis of our discussion : Which is used as follows : The output of which is as follows in Spidermonkey : His opinion was that since the Javascript function primitive does not natively support `` partial function application '' , it 's completely wrong to refer to the function bound to the variable karahi as partially applied . His argument was that when the vindaloo function is curried , the function itself is completely applied and a closure is returned , not a `` partially applied function '' .Now , my opinion is that while Javascript itself does not provide support for partial application in its ' function primitives ( unlike say , ML or Haskell ) , that does n't mean you ca n't create a higher order function of the language which is capable of encapsulating concept of a partially applied function . Also , despite being `` applied '' , the scope of the function is still bound to the closure returned by it causing it to remain `` partially applied '' .Which is correct ?"

"I 'm creating an API for multiple customers . The core endpoints like /users are used by every customer but some endpoints rely on individual customization . So it might be that User A wants a special endpoint /groups and no other customer will have that feature . Just as a sidenote , each customer would also use his own database schema because of those extra features.I personally use NestJs ( Express under the hood ) . So the app.module currently registers all my core modules ( with their own endpoints etc . ) I think this problem is not related to NestJs so how would you handle that in theory ? I basically need an infrastructure that is able to provide a basic system . There are no core endpoints anymore because each extension is unique and multiple /users implementations could be possible . When developing a new feature the core application should not be touched . Extensions should integrate themselves or should get integrated on startup . The core system ships with no endpoints but will be extended from those external files.Some ideas come to my mindFirst approach : Each extension represents a new repository . Define a path to a custom external folder holding all that extension projects . This custom directory would contain a folder groups with a groups.moduleMy API could loop through that directory and try to import each module file.pros : The custom code is kept away from the core repositorycons : NestJs uses Typescript so I have to compile the code first . How would I manage the API build and the builds from the custom apps ? ( Plug and play system ) The custom extensions are very loose because they just contain some typescript files . Due to the fact they do n't have access to the node_modules directory of the API , my editor will show me errors because it ca n't resolve external package dependencies.Some extensions might fetch data from another extension . Maybe the groups service needs to access the users service . Things might get tricky here.Second approach : Keep each extension inside a subfolder of the src folder of the API . But add this subfolder to the .gitignore file . Now you can keep your extensions inside the API.pros : Your editor is able to resolve the dependenciesBefore deploying your code you can run the build command and will have a single distributionYou can access other services easily ( /groups needs to find a user by id ) cons : When developing you have to copy your repository files inside that subfolder . After changing something you have to copy these files back and override your repository files with the updated ones.Third approach : Inside an external custom folder , all extensions are fully fledged standalone APIs . Your main API would just provide the authentication stuff and could act as a proxy to redirect the incoming requests to the target API.pros : New extensions can be developed and tested easilycons : Deployment will be tricky . You will have a main API and n extension APIs starting their own process and listening to a port.The proxy system could be tricky . If the client requests /users the proxy needs to know which extension API listens for that endpoint , calls that API and forwards that response back to the client.To protect the extension APIs ( authentication is handled by the main API ) the proxy needs to share a secret with those APIs . So the extension API will only pass incoming requests if that matching secret is provided from the proxy.Fourth approach : Microservices might help . I took a guide from here https : //docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basicsI could have a microservice for the user management , group management etc . and consume those services by creating a small api / gateway / proxy that calls those microservices.pros : New extensions can be developed and tested easilySeparated concernscons : Deployment will be tricky . You will have a main API and n microservices starting their own process and listening to a port.It seems that I would have to create a new gateway api for each customer if I want to have it customizable . So instead of extending an application I would have to create a customized comsuming API each time . That would n't solve the problem.To protect the extension APIs ( authentication is handled by the main API ) the proxy needs to share a secret with those APIs . So the extension API will only pass incoming requests if that matching secret is provided from the proxy ."

"I 'm probably about a 7 or 8 on proficiency with jQuery ( on a scale of 1-10 ) , so I 'm not sure if this even makes sense , but I 'd like to know if anyone knows of a jQuery function or possibly a plugin which allows a branch of jQuery to only be executed if a given condition is true . Otherwise , I 'd love to hear if someone thinks the concept is flawed in some way ( EDIT and how it is flawed ) While one could control attachment of various events using normal JavaScript syntax similar to this : I was wondering if there is a way to do it all in jQuery or if there is a good reason not to ... something perhaps like this : Note : I think this is syntactically correct , assuming the booleans and functions are defined appropriately , but I 'm pretty sure I 've gotten the intent across pretty clearlythe proposed jQuery seems a little neater to me ( ? ? ) agree/disagree ? - so here are my questions : Is there some part of native jQuery that basically already does this ? Is there an extension already out there that allows this type of thing ? Is it harder to do than I am thinking ? ( I 'd think something like keeping the current element set if the condition is true , pushing an empty element set if condition is false , then popping the element set back out for each or condition would do it , just like the end ( ) method pops back the previous set after a find ( ) call ) Is there something that makes it significantly less efficient ? EDITThe question asks how to do this with method chaining or why it would be unadvisable ( specifics preferred ) . While it does n't ask for alternatives , such alternatives might be necessary to explain problems with a jQuery chaining approach . Also , since the example above immediately evaluates the booleans , any other solution should do the same ."

"Possible Duplicate : Conflicting boolean values of an empty JavaScript array What is the rationale behind the fact thatreturns [ true , 1 ] ? In other words an empty list is logically true in a boolean context , but is equal to false.I know that using === solves the issue , but what is the explanation behind this apparently totally illogical choice ? In other words is this considered a mistake in the language , something unintentional that just happened and that can not be fixed because it 's too late or really in the design of the language someone thought it was cool to have this kind of apparent madness that I 'm sure is quite confusing for many programmers ? The technical explanation of how this happens is at the same time amazing and scaring , I was however more interested in what is behind this design.EditI accepted very detailed Nick Retallack explanation , even if it 's only about the technical reasons of why [ ] ==false is true : surprisingly enough it happens is because [ ] converted to string is an empty string and the empty string numeric value is special cased to be 0 instead of the apparently more logical NaN . With an empty object for example the comparison ( { } ) == false returns false because the string representation of an empty object is not the empty string.My curiosity still remains about all this being just unanticipated ( and now unfortunately solidified in a standard ) ."

If yours is up to date try the following : Step though the unminified version of jQuery to see if the issue is inside the library ( which 9 times out of 10 it probably will not be ) When all else fails , just write a pure javascript solution.Sometimes when I am writing a `` class '' in javscript with jQuery , jQuery will just not function as it should . For example today I was doing the following on an input select : $ ( this ) .val ( newValue ) ; This was working in jFiddle just fine , but not working in my project ( both had 0 script errors ) . I tried to isolate the code as much as possible , but to no avail I could not get it to work.The `` solution '' for this was to just write straight up javascript to set the value and it worked just fine . I am not a jQuery master , but this is not the first time I had to write a straight javascript solution when jQuery `` failed . '' Do any jQuery masters out there know why something like this might happen ? Is there a method of debugging jQuery I am not aware of ? Does anyone else run into these types of problems with jQuery ? If so , do you have a solution ? Update ( s ) : Aug 25 , 2011I downloaded the most recent version of the jQuery library and stepped through it only to find that the bug was probably resolved between jQuery 1.4.4 and 1.6.2 . I did n't realize the person who handles most of the javascript was n't keeping the jQuery library up to date . After stepping through the jQuery 1.4.4 library it seems that jQuery was not able to find my selector for some reason and therefore was never setting the value . This problem has been resolved in 1.6.2 ... .Lesson of the week ... keep your jQuery library up to date and verify your senior developer 's statements when things are n't matching up . -I chose the answer I did because it was the only one which really helped me diagnose the source of the problem . While stepping through the unminified version of jQuery is such a simple solution , I actually should have done that before posting this question . I will post my findings as to why it did n't work later.Aug 24 , 2011I agree with the user Sohnee that having a duplicate 'name ' is n't bad practice and in some places you actually need it . I feel rather stupid because the posted code has been wrong for almost a week now . I have updated the code . I moved the init function to the public scope.Aug 22 , 2011While I am partially satisfied that the core of the problem is with duplicate names , I need to know why are duplicate names bad ? I know when dealing with inputs/css/etc you usually except IDs to be unique and classes to represent groups . I did n't think there were any rules about names , but if someone can explain to me why having duplicate names is bad practice , I will consider that the answer to this problem . Aug 16 , 2011As for the current answers , I do n't think it is a conflict . jQuery is working just fine . The binds are triggering causing the functions to be called in both implementations . The problem line is For example , if I console out newVal in the .each ( ) it will have a value of lets say ' A'.Then if I console log out $ ( this ) .val ( ) it will be ' B ' . Then $ ( this ) .val ( newVal ) ; is run . After that if I do a console log of $ ( this ) .val ( ) it will still be ' B'.In the comments someone mentioned that I might be using the word this wrong . Both of these returned 0 javascript errors on Chrome 's console . I will give the following code snippet was what was having problems . I will write the original and then what I replaced it with javascript.I am aware the name is the same , but that is ok . The page I am working on is a huge form and the cloned select is just to make the user not have to scroll back to another part of the form.HTML : jQuery ( this does not work ) : Javascript ( this works ) :"

"DisclaimerGuys , I DO aware of Why does 10..toString ( ) work , but 10.toString ( ) does not ? question existence , but the thing is that it does n't provide the formal explanation .

However , element does not contain a property called value . But I notice there is a sub-object called HTMLElement which has a sub-object HTMLInputElement . And that object contains a property called value.Is that code above somehow typecast as the child object ? Why does the value property work as such ?"

"Relevant information : The page contains two elements : An < aside > to the left.A < main > to the right . ( Note : Throughout this post , heights are mentioned for the sake of completeness , but are irrelevant to producing this problem . ) All heights , widths , and margins are set with respect to var w = screen.width/100 ; ( and var h = screen.height/100 ; ) so that the page essentially looks the same in any display resolution . And they are set so that the width of < aside > and < main > , and the margin between them all add up to screen.width.For example : ( 85.5 + 14 + 0.5 = 100 ) The problem : The < main > gets pushed down below the < aside > for unknown reasons . I can only think of a half-sensible hypothesis to somewhat explain this behavior.However , if I set the font size of the body to 0 and zoom out ( so that the elements take less space ) and zoom back in , this gets fixed ( I do n't know why , and do n't ask me how I found this out ) .What is the reason for this behavior , and what is the proper fix ? The hypothesis ( can be skipped ) : The browser seems to think `` What would happen if I display the scrollbars even though they are not needed ? `` , and then notices that the scrollbars have a width > 0 , which means that < aside > and < main > are taking more space than available ( since they are set to take up 100 % of the screen width , and now there is a scrollbar competing for the space ) . The browser therefore decides to reposition the < main > below the < aside > and ruin the design . And now since < main > is under < aside > the elements no longer fit inside the screen and the scrollbars are actually needed now and therefore stay , even though they are the cause of their own existence ( as far as this hypothesis goes ) .Additional information : I am not using any CSS-stylesheet : all my styling is done by JavaScript ( for the simple reason that I want the sizes to depend on screen.width and screen.height ) .The elements have display = `` inline-block '' ; . Using float produces horrendous behavior when the browser is anything but max size.Here is the code to reproduce the problem :"

"Title mostly says it all : I 'm building a react / relay application which will allow the user to dynamically create charts at runtime displaying their various income streams over a specified time range .

These values are defined in the schema as a GraphQLInputObjectType instance as follows : On the client-side , I have react-relay fragments defined of the following form : This variable value will be populated as part of dropdown menu in a separate component where each value in the dropdown should correspond to a valid timeSeriesIntervalEnum value . Although it would certainly be possible to simply hardcode these values in , the underlying API is still being changed quite often and I would like to reduce coupling and instead populate these fields dynamically by specifying the variable type for a given dropdown ( e.g . timeSeriesIntervalEnum ) and then use the graphql client schema to parse the values and populate either a config json file ( pre-runtime ) or assign the values dynamically at runtime.NOTE : I already do a bit of query string and fragment transpilation pre-start , so I 'm not averse to creating json config files as part of this process if that is required ."

"I want to implement authentication and authorization in the Flatiron stack ( using Flatiron , Resourceful and Restful ) . I want to require that a user has the necessary permissions , when trying to change a resource . In the Restful Readme file , there 's a note about authorization : There are several ways to provide security and authorization for accessing resource methods exposed with restful . The recommended pattern for authorization is to use resourceful 's ability for before and after hooks . In these hooks , you can add additional business logic to restrict access to the resource 's methods . It is not recommended to place authorization logic in the routing layer , as in an ideal world the router will be a reflected interface of the resource . In theory , the security of the router itself should be somewhat irrelevant since the resource could have multiple reflected interfaces that all required the same business logic . TL ; DR ; For security and authorization , you should use resourceful 's before and after hooks.So authorization can be handled by Resourceful 's hooking system.My actual problem is the authentication process at the beginning of every HTTP request.Let 's say I have a resource Post , a User and a resource Session . The REST API is being defined by using Restful . My main concern for this question is to ensure that a user has a session when creating a post . Other methods like save , update or for other resources like creating a user should work analogous.File app.js : File resources.js : There 's also a runnable version of the code ( thanks @ generalhenry ) .So assume a user trying to create a post , already has been given a session id , that is sent with every request he makes by a cookie header .

"The answer to this question has been clear to me ever since I read/learned about CSSOM , until today .

Let 's replace the < style > with ... and make test.php hang for a few seconds : If I am right ( and js execution is deferred until CSSOM is built ) , the page hangs blank for 10 seconds , before building CSSOM and before executing the < script > that would comment the < link / > out and would allow the page to render.If he is right , the js is ran as it 's met and the < link / > request never leaves , because it 's a comment by now.Surprise : the page renders right away .

"I have a SPA ( in Aurelia / TypeScript but that should not matter ) which uses SystemJS . Let 's say it runs at http : //spa:5000/app.It sometimes loads JavaScript modules like waterservice/external.js on demand from an external URL like http : //otherhost:5002/fetchmodule ? moduleId=waterservice.external.js . I use SystemJS.import ( url ) to do this and it works fine.But when this external module wants to import another module with a simple import { OtherClass } from './other-class ' ; this ( comprehensiblely ) does not work . When loaded by the SPA it looks at http : //spa:5000/app/other-class.js . In this case I have to intercept the path/location to redirect it to http : //otherhost:5002/fetchmodule ? moduleId=other-class.js.Note : The Typescript compilation for waterservice/external.ts works find because the typescript compiler can find ./other-class.ts easily . Obviously I can not use an absolute URL for the import.How can I intercept the module loading inside a module I am importing with SystemJS ? One approach I already tested is to add a mapping in the SystemJS configuration . If I import it like import { OtherClass } from 'other-class ' ; and add a mapping like `` other-class '' : `` http : //otherhost:5002/fetchmodule ? moduleId=other-class '' it works . But if this approach is good , how can I add mapping dynamically at runtime ? Other approaches like a generic load url interception are welcome too.UpdateI tried to intercept SystemJS as suggest by artem like thisThis would normally not change anything but produce some console output to see what is going on . Unfortunately this seems to do change something as I get an error Uncaught ( in promise ) TypeError : this.has is not a function inside system.js.Then I tried to add mappings with SystemJS.config ( { map : ... } ) ; . Surprisingly this function works incremental , so when I call it , it does not loose the already provided mappings . So I can do : This does not work with relative paths ( those which start with . or .. ) but if I put the shared ones in the root this works out.I would still prefer to intercept the loading to be able to handle more scenarios but at the moment I have no idea which has function is missing in the above approach ."

"I have a wasm process ( compiled from c++ ) that processes data inside a web application . Let 's say the necessary code looks like this : This code basically `` runs/processes a query '' similar to a SQL query interface : However , queries may take several minutes to run/process and at any given time the user may cancel their query . The cancellation process would occur in the normal javascript/web application , outside of the service Worker running the wasm.My question then is what would be an example of how we could know that the user has clicked the 'cancel ' button and communicate it to the wasm process so that knows the process has been cancelled so it can exit ? Using the worker.terminate ( ) is not an option , as we need to keep all the loaded data for that worker and can not just kill that worker ( it needs to stay alive with its stored data , so another query can be run ... ) .What would be an example way to communicate here between the javascript and worker/wasm/c++ application so that we can know when to exit , and how to do it properly ? Additionally , let us suppose a typical query takes 60s to run and processes 500MB of data in-browser using cpp/wasm.Update : I think there are the following possible solutions here based on some research ( and the initial answers/comments below ) with some feedback on them : Use two workers , with one worker storing the data and another worker processing the data . In this way the processing-worker can be terminated , and the data will always remain . Feasible ? Not really , as it would take way too much time to copy over ~ 500MB of data to the webworker whenever it starts . This could have been done ( previously ) using SharedArrayBuffer , but its support is now quite limited/nonexistent due to some security concerns . Too bad , as this seems like by far the best solution if it were supported ... Use a single worker using Emterpreter and using emscripten_sleep_with_yield . Feasible ? No , destroys performance when using Emterpreter ( mentioned in the docs above ) , and slows down all queries by about 4-6x.Always run a second worker and in the UI just display the most recent . Feasible ? No , would probably run into quite a few OOM errors if it 's not a shared data structure and the data size is 500MB x 2 = 1GB ( 500MB seems to be a large though acceptable size when running in a modern desktop browser/computer ) .Use an API call to a server to store the status and check whether the query is cancelled or not . Feasible ? Yes , though it seems quite heavy-handed to long-poll with network requests every second from every running query.Use an incremental-parsing approach where only a row at a time is parsed . Feasible ? Yes , but also would require a tremendous amount of re-writing the parsing functions so that every function supports this ( the actual data parsing is handled in several functions -- filter , search , calculate , group by , sort , etc . etc.Use IndexedDB and store the state in javascript . Allocate a chunk of memory in WASM , then return its pointer to JavaScript . Then read database there and fill the pointer . Then process your data in C++ . Feasible ? Not sure , though this seems like the best solution if it can be implemented . [ Anything else ? ] In the bounty then I was wondering three things : If the above six analyses seem generally valid ? Are there other ( perhaps better ) approaches I 'm missing ? Would anyone be able to show a very basic example of doing # 6 -- seems like that would be the best solution if it 's possible and works cross-browser ."

"I 'm working on a PHP-MySQL web app , and the available tools for server load testing are cumbersome and confusing .

Example : http : //jsfiddle.net/cxgkY/15/Updated : The inner HTML might contains variable sized text"
"The iScroll project provides the “ overflow : scroll for mobile WebKit ” , and was started [ … ] because webkit for iPhone does not provide a native way to scroll content inside a fixed size ( width/height ) div . So basically it was impossible to have a fixed header/footer and a scrolling central area.We have developed a mobile-friendly Web application , using responsive design ( etc . ) , that uses a layout that sometimes show a fixed header and footer on mobile devices , based on the core-layout library , which in turn uses angular-iscroll . You can try out the core-layout demo on desktop and mobile , and try to turn the use of iScroll on and off . On desktop scrolling the different areas should work both with and without iScroll ( given that the window is not too high so that scrolling is not necessary ) ; on mobile , however , whether scrolling works without iScroll depends on the kind and version of the browser.Recent versions of the mobile Safari browser , and Android browsers , have started to support overflow : scroll for such fixed-size div elements as described above . Therefore , some browsers still need the use of iScroll to work , while other browsers do n't . Because using iScroll introduces some problems on it own , like proper click and touch event handling , I would like to turn off iScroll in all browsers that do n't need it.I would like to add support in angular-iscroll or core-layout for automatically detecting if there is any need to use iScroll or not for each browser opening the page . I know about feature detection libraries like modernizr , but it seems hard to determine the need for iScroll based on feature detection . Does anyone know how such auto-detection can be implemented ? Another possibility is to use a white/black-list and check the browser version , but in that case I wonder if anyone has a reliable rule set for properly determining the need to use iScroll based on the user-agent string ? Disclosure : I 'm the author of both angular-iscroll and core-layout.Update 2016-01-10 : Since no one have suggested any answers yet , I thought that I could share some ideas I 've had of how to solve this : If it is difficult to implement a solution to the above problem through true feature detection , one possible way could be to utilize platform.js , a platform detection library that works on nearly all JavaScript platforms . By including the platform.js script , you easily get access to information about the current browser such aswhich could be used for matching against a rule set . However , then theproblem becomes what those rules should be , to avoid turning off iScroll for browsers that need iScroll to work , and to avoid turning iScroll on for browsers that do n't need it.Another way might be to exploit that , given a scrollable div with higher contents that the div 's height , then the scroll area should scroll when swiped , and one could try to detect whether or not that happens.Consider this scenario : let 's assume that you start of with iScroll turned off . Now , if the user tries to scroll the contents of the div , but the contents do n't move , then perhaps one could conclude that one must turn iScroll on for div-scrolling to work ? How would that be implemented while providing a relatively smooth user experience ? It might depend on how fast one can detect that the contents should have scrolled but did n't ? If anyone can come up with robust solutions based on one of those ideas ( or a combination of them ) , then I 'm just happy to help.Also , I wonder why no one tries to come up with an answer ; not even a comment that says this is too difficult/trivial/irrelevant/strange/outdated ?"

"[ Background ] The default print ( ) function of QScriptEngine prints the result to the terminal of Qt Creator IDE for debugging purpose . As a result , the output must be redirected to our texteditor if we are going to make a ECMA script interpreter ourselves.This part of the document `` Making Applications Scriptable '' remains untouched since Qt 4.3.Section `` Redefining print ( ) '' : Qt Script provides a built-in print ( ) function that can be useful for simple debugging purposes . The built-in print ( ) function writes to standard output . You can redefine the print ( ) function ( or add your own function , e.g . debug ( ) or log ( ) ) that redirects the text to somewhere else . The following code shows a custom print ( ) that adds text to a QPlainTextEdit.So here is the suggested re-definition of print ( ) : At first , I doubted the need of returning an `` Undefined Value '' by return engine- > undefinedValue ( ) ; , and it looks like the role of the argument *engine is just to return this void value.So here is what I 've done to change the function : which I think is more reasonable to me : returning an evaluated QScriptValue from script engine , and the value can later be translated to QString for output . This bypass the need of dynamic type cast , which could become messy especially for customized QObjects . For both kinds of print function , here is the exposition to the script engine : Evaluation and output : [ Compilable Code ] ( Qt version > 4 is needed ) test.promain.cppconsole.hconsole.cpp [ Example ] Input 1 : Output ( Qt Document QtPrintFunction ( ) ) : Output ( My version myPrintFunction ( ) ) : Input 2 : Output ( Qt Document QtPrintFunction ( ) ) : 0 1 2 undefinedOutput ( myPrintFunction ( ) ) : 2Input 3 : Output ( Qt Document QtPrintFunction ( ) ) : Stack Overflow undefinedOutput ( My version myPrintFunction ( ) ) : Overflow [ Question ] Although myPrintFunction seems to work fine at first , it did n't work when there are more than two print called in a script , where only the last print will be executed .

On the SVG component , I have also added 6 black boxes on the right hand side , which I use as a radio button group built directly onto the SVG using D3.For a variety of state reasons ( mainly because I would like my container component to hold the state of the graph , since the container component will have other parts that require the button values ) , I am working on building a set of React radio buttons , to replace the D3 SVG radio buttons , but am struggling with the positioning of the buttons . Given the way I 've made the SVG ( using Viewbox ) , the React radio buttons built directly onto the SVG rescale as the width of the browser window changes . This is important not because viewers of my website will be actively changing the browser window size ( they wont be ) , but rather because I dont know how wide the users browser is , and this resizing of the buttons with the resizing of the SVG means the buttons will always look good.However , the React radio buttons do not scale . As you can see here : I use position = absolute|relative , along with top|bottom|left styles in order to position the buttons on top of the SVG . I also change the z-index on the react radio button divs so that they are on top of the SVG . Before reviewing the code , please run the code snippet and open to full screen , and increase and decrease the width of your browser window.My question is this : How do i do the sizing and positioning correctly with the React radio buttons so that they behave ( from a size and positioning standpoint ) in a manner similar to if had built the radio buttons directly into the SVG ( how the black boxes are resizing ) ? Any help at all is appreciated with this ."

"When I ran my MVC 4 project in Release mode , one page that uses SlickGrid did not display correctly ( the grid is very , very tall and the grid cells are missing ) .However , I do not think this is an issue of SlickGrid , but rather of how the bundler ( System.Web.Optimization that is integrated into MVC 4 ) minified the code.I grabbed the minified JavaScript and began reversing minification in one area at a time until the problem was fixed . I found that changing ( and forgive the scrolling , I want to leave the minified version exactly as-is ) to the originalresolves the issue if all other elements of the minified file are unchanged.The function is used like : to provide a callback function for SlickGrid to filter out certain results.How is it that the original and the minified function are not equivalent ? UPDATESlickGrid is `` compiling '' the filter function that I provide . That compilation step is failing with the minified version . The compiled minified code looks like : Note the multiple return statements.With this additional insight , I was able to identify a relevant SlickGrid bug : https : //github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/issues/301"

"Recently I 've taken to learning Sails JS , and while it seems incredibly useful ( I do n't have to build an api on my own ? ! ) the current little project I 'm testing sails with has run into a bit of a snag . My main profession is a teacher , and the eventual goal for this whole project is to have a list of students , peers who they work well with ( friend_id ) , and students who they do not ( unfriend_id ) . Using this information , plus their current GPA , I want to optimize the seating chart through some other algorithms . First part , I need to get the data returned to from the Sails data server to agree with me . What I need for sails to do ( and I 've looked through the sails docs at one-to-many collections as well as many-to-many and many-to-one but this problem seems particular ) is to gather all of the items for a user based on the friend_id or unfriend_id column . DataThis SqlFiddle has the basic schema setup with some dummy data for everyone to copy/paste over and work with directly if needed.usersrelationsdummy data ( ignore the names ) I tried something like the following , but when I run this the api returns an empty json array for both ( before I would at least receive a list of the students / relations depending on the api I was looking ) .

"In Python , you can implement __call__ ( ) for a class such that calling an instance of the class itself executes the __call__ ( ) method.Do JavaScript classes have an equivalent method ? EditA summary answer incorporating the discussion here : Python and JavaScript objects are not similar enough for a true equivalent ( prototype vs. class based , self , vs. this ) The API can be achieved however using proxy or modifying the prototype – and maybe using bind ? One should generally not do this : it is too far removed from the JS 's structure and from the normal use of of JavaScript , potentially creating confusion among other JS devs , your future-self , and could result in idiosyncratic side-effects ."

"The context : My question relates to improving web-page loading performance , and in particular the effect that javascript has on page-loading ( resources/elements below the script are blocked from downloading/rendering ) .This problem is usually avoided/mitigated by placing the scripts at the bottom ( eg , just before the tag ) . The code i am looking at is for web analytics . Placing it at the bottom reduces its accuracy ; and because this script has no effect on the page 's content , ie , it 's not re-writing any part of the page -- i want to move it inside the head . Just how to do that without ruining page-loading performance is the crux.From my research , i 've found six techniques ( w/ support among all or most of the major browsers ) for downloading scripts so that they do n't block down-page content from loading/rendering : ( i ) XHR + eval ( ) ; ( ii ) XHR + inject ; ( iii ) download the HTML-wrapped script as in iFrame ; ( iv ) setting the script tag 's async flag to TRUE ( HTML 5 only ) ; ( v ) setting the script tag 's defer attribute ; and ( vi ) 'Script DOM Element'.It 's the last of these i do n't understand . The javascript to implement the pattern ( vi ) is : Seems simple enough : and anonymous function is created then executed in the same block . Inside this anonymous function : a script element is createdits src element is set to it 's location , thenthe script element is added to the DOMBut while each line is clear , it 's still not clear to me how exactly this pattern allows script loading without blocking down-page elements/resources from rendering/loading ?"

"I know that there are several ways to define a function in JavaScript . Two of the most common ones are : I am comfortable with the idea of a function as an object that can be passed around just like any other variable . So I understand perfectly what ( 2 ) is doing .

I already know that it makes a difference in execution order : if I use ( 1 ) then I can refer to add ( ) before the point in the code where add ( ) is defined , but if I use ( 2 ) then I have to assign my function to add before I can start referring to add ( ) .Is ( 1 ) just a shortcut for ( 2 ) , albeit one that happens to behave like other C-style languages in allowing us to define a function `` below '' the point at which it 's used ?

"Please note : The following is an issue that behaves differently on different browsers . So perhaps this is a browser implementation issue . I would love some advice regardless.In my application , I am creating a couple of promises that I may not be consuming until quite some time in the future . Which should be fine , they are promises , after all.If the promise being stored away is resolved , there is no issue . I can consume it as far in the future as I want , and as many times as I want . As expected.If the promise being stored away is rejected , however , there is an issue . Unless I consume that rejection shortly after it is made ( not sure how shortly ) a console message will crop up in Chrome or Firefox indicating that there is an uncaught promise rejection/error . IE does not pop up that error.So consider the following code : Note that there is no use or consumption of the promise foo . It is merely stored away for some future use.The console on IE looks like this : About to make a promise rejection.Promise rejection made.Which is expected . However , the same code on Chrome will yield the following console : About to make a promise rejection.Promise rejection made.Uncaught ( in promise ) Error : Foo Rejected Promise . ( … ) Firefox looks pretty much like Chrome , other than the wording around the `` uncaught '' error.But the thing is that I intend to handle this `` error '' much later , at the time I am consuming the promise . Merely HAVING a rejected promise should not cause a console error ... .. that should happen if I consume the promise and do n't handle the error.To simulate a `` much later '' handling of the error , consider this alteration of the code : Now in this case , we `` handle '' the error by displaying something on the console after a timeout . Now IE still handles this as I would expect : About to make a promise rejection.Promise rejection made.Displaying Foo Rejected Promise . 10 seconds later.In this case , Firefox does like IE , and displays exactly these messages , and does not give me an erroneous console error.Chrome , however , still gives the erroneous error : About to make a promise rejection.Promise rejection made.Uncaught ( in promise ) Error : Foo Rejected Promise . ( … ) Displaying Foo Rejected Promise . 10 seconds later.So Chrome both complained about my error not being handled , and then displayed that it was handled.It appears that I can get around all this with the following code that that seems like a hack . Basically I do a `` fake '' handling of the error when the promise is created and then really handle it the way I want to later : But this is ugly code.My question is twofold - is there some way of looking at what Chrome ( and to some extent FireFox ) is doing and think of it as a favor ? Because to me it seems awful . And secondly , is there a better way of getting around this than the hack of pretending to handle an error when you are n't ? Thanks in advance ."

"The Wikipedia article on the Y combinator provides the following JavaScript implementation of the Y combinator : The existence of a Y combinator in JavaScript should imply that every JavaScript function has a fixed point ( since for every function g , Y ( g ) and g ( Y ( g ) ) should be equal ) .However , it is n't hard to come up with functions without fixed points that violate Y ( g ) = g ( Y ( g ) ) ( see here ) . Even certain functionals do not have fixed points ( see here ) .How does the proof that every function has a fixed point reconcile with the given counter-examples ? Is JavaScript not an untyped lambda calculus in which the proof that Y ( g ) = g ( Y ( g ) ) applies ?"

I saw a video about the Recaman Sequence by Numberphile . If you do n't know the algorithm you can look at this link : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=FGC5TdIiT9U or this one : https : //blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/2018/07/09/the-oeis-and-the-recaman-sequence/I wrote a little piece of software with Processing and p5.js to visualize the sequence .

I 've found how it handles addition over daylight savings time and leap years , but nothing at all for leap seconds.To give some background as to why this is important : I need to create a CSV file with a bunch of minute-by-minute sensor data for various sensors , formatted like : My data is stored with with the timestamp for the start of an hour , then an array of sixty data points for the hour.I turn this into a bunch of timestamp 'd data by giving the first data point the hour 's timestamp and adding sixty seconds to that value for each subsequent data point ( as leap seconds always happen at the end of the hour and I only ever do an hour at a time , this should be fine ) . I then will need to build a dictionary mapping each timestamp to the value at that minute . This is necessary so that I can have the right data in the right row of the CSV ; sensors may have started at different times or may have been powered off for a certain hour or not reported for a certain part of the hour ; I ca n't just assume that all sensors have the same data . I 'm finding all of the timestamps over which the CSV will be created with the following code : But I 'm not sure if it 's safe .

"Requirements and backgroundI want a generic randomInt function that can handle a range of values upto and including Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER to Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER and that the values returned are uniformly distributed.So , I started at MDN and looked at the Math.random page . They give an example , which appears to be uniformly distributed.But it comes with the following note . Note that as numbers in JavaScript are IEEE 754 floating point numbers with round-to-nearest-even behavior , the ranges claimed for the functions below ( excluding the one for Math.random ( ) itself ) are n't exact . If extremely large bounds are chosen ( 2^53 or higher ) , it 's possible in extremely rare cases to calculate the usually-excluded upper bound.I 'm wanting to use the range - ( 2^53 - 1 ) and 2^53 - 1 , so I believe that this note does not apply . I then notice max - min : this is going to be a problem for the larger ranges that I have specified : Example - max rangeSolution 1 - not a solutionOff I go and have a little play and come up with the following code , based on the MDN example and my requirements.But as you can see , this is going to throw an error well before the larger ranges that I require.Solution 2 - solves the math issue but seems to break uniformitySo I have a fiddle and come up with the following.While we no longer throw an error and the math appears to be within the max safe integer values , I am not sure exactly how this has effected the uniform distribution of the original MDN example ( if it was uniformly distributed ) ? My testing seems to suggest that this breaks the uniform distribution.Graph of distributionSolution 3 - not a solutionSo on I press and take a look creating Box-Muller Transform function for creating the random normally distributed range that I thought I required ( but my mistake I wanted uniformly distributed ) . I did some reading and chose rejection sampling as the method to generate observations from a distribution . Found out how to calculate the deviation for a range without having to use Math.sqrt : If the value of x is negative , Math.sqrt ( ) returns NaNThis is what I came up with.Not sure that I have done everything correctly ( have n't broken the normal distribution ) , but on small integer ranges I am seeing the correct range of random integers generated.But there is still a problem when I use the maximum limits of the range ( or actually before those limits ) . The math still goes outside of the Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER value . Output from above console.log ( tmp ) ; As you can see the calculated variance is not safe . This algorithm can be ignored due to my confusion in distribution types.Graph of distributionI 've included this so that you can see that I was actually quite close to having this work as a normal distribution , even though this is not what I actually required . It may aid someone that is looking to perform this kind of distribution.What is or is there a solution ? So , what am I missing ? Is there some simple method that I have overlooked ? Must I use a big number library as a solution ? How to test the distribution : I have some graphs that I 'm plotting , which is fine for a small range but the larger ranges are just not possible ? Please put me out of my misery on this one . : )"
"Help ! I 'm learning to love Javascript after programming in C # for quite a while but I 'm stuck learning to love the iterable protocol ! Why did Javascript adopt a protocol that requires creating a new object for each iteration ? Why have next ( ) return a new object with properties done and value instead of adopting a protocol like C # IEnumerable and IEnumerator which allocates no object at the expense of requiring two calls ( one to moveNext to see if the iteration is done , and a second to current to get the value ) ? Are there under-the-hood optimizations that skip the allocation of the object return by next ( ) ? Hard to imagine given the iterable does n't know how the object could be used once returned ... Generators do n't seem to reuse the next object as illustrated below : Hm , here 's a clue ( thanks to Bergi ! ) : We will answer one important question later ( in Sect . 3.2 ) : Why can iterators ( optionally ) return a value after the last element ? That capability is the reason for elements being wrapped . Otherwise , iterators could simply return a publicly defined sentinel ( stop value ) after the last element.And in Sect . 3.2 they discuss using Using generators as lightweight threads . Seems to say the reason for return an object from next is so that a value can be returned even when done is true ! Whoa . Furthermore , generators can return values in addition to yield and yield*-ing values and a value generated by return ends up as in value when done is true ! And all this allows for pseudo-threading . And that feature , pseudo-threading , is worth allocating a new object for each time around the loop ... Javascript . Always so unexpected ! Although , now that I think about it , allowing yield* to `` return '' a value to enable a pseudo-threading still does n't justify returning an object . The IEnumerator protocol could be extended to return an object after moveNext ( ) returns false -- just add a property hasCurrent to test after the iteration is complete that when true indicates current has a valid value ... And the compiler optimizations are non-trivial . This will result in quite wild variance in the performance of an iterator ... does n't that cause problems for library implementors ? All these points are raised in this thread discovered by the friendly SO community . Yet , those arguments did n't seem to hold the day.However , regardless of returning an object or not , no one is going to be checking for a value after iteration is `` complete '' , right ? E.g . most everyone would think the following would log all values returned by an iterator : Except it does n't because even though done is false the iterator might still have returned another value . Consider : Is an iterator that returns a value after its `` done '' is really an iterator ? What is the sound of one hand clapping ? It just seems quite odd ... And here is in depth post on generators I enjoyed . Much time is spent controlling the flow of an application as opposed to iterating members of a collection . Another possible explanation is that IEnumerable/IEnumerator requires two interfaces and three methods and the JS community preferred the simplicity of a single method . That way they would n't have to introduce the notion of groups of symbolic methods aka interfaces ..."

"A bit of an architectural question ... I originally created a Javascript singleton to house methods needed to operate a photo gallery module in a template file for a CMS system . The original specification only called for one instance of this photo gallery module on a page .

Now , the HTML markup is safe , because I used class names , but how would I go about restructuring my Javascript and jQuery event listeners to be able to handle multiple modules ? You may assume that each photo gallery has its own JSON-P file ( or you may assume a single JSON-P file if you think it can be handled more elegantly with one JSON-P file ) .I think my original jQuery event listeners might have to be converted to $ .delegate ( ) , but I have no clue what to do after that and what to do about converting my singleton .

Use Case : I 'm consuming a REST Api which provides battle results of a video game . It is a team vs team online game and each team consists of 3 players who can pick different one from 100 different characters . I want to count the number of wins / losses and draws for each team combination . I get roughly 1000 battle results per second . I concatenate the character ids ( ascending ) of each team and then I save the wins/losses and draws for each combination.My current implementation : For each returned log I perform an upsert and send these queries in bulk ( 5-30 rows ) to MongoDB : My problem : As long as I just have a few thousand entries in my collection combinationStats mongodb takes just 0-2 % cpu . Once the collection has a couple million documents ( which happens pretty quickly due to the amount of possible combinations ) MongoDB constantly takes 50-100 % cpu . Apparently my approach is not scalable at all.My question : Either of these options could be a solution to my above defined problem : Can I optimize the performance of my MongoDB solution described above so that it does n't take that much CPU ? ( I already indexed the fields I filter on and I perform upserts in bulk ) . Would it help to create a hash ( based on all my filter fields ) which I could use for filtering the data then to improve performance ? Is there a better database / technology suited to aggregate such data ? I could imagine a couple more use cases where I want/need to increment a counter for a given identifier.Edit : After khang commented that it might be related to the upsert performance I replaced my $ inc with a $ set and indeed the performance was equally `` poor '' . Hence I tried the suggested find ( ) and then manually update ( ) approach but the results did n't become any better .

I have a photo gallery powered by Isotope.Images are requested from external resource on page load and every time a user scrolls to the bottom of the page . New images are to be appended to the current isotope layout . The problem is with Isotope - it does n't seem to execute the 'appended ' method.Searching for a solution on StackExchange and Google revealed I am not the only one having this problem . I have been tinkering with this for past couple of days and tried almost every solution I could find but so far I have not found anything that could fix my problem.CodePen : I have created a CodePen here - http : //codepen.io/Writech/pen/pBoEtWebPage : As the custom event 'resizestop ' is not working in codepen the same code is found as a webpage here - http : //writech.net.ee/sandbox/To see the problem open the CodePen or WebPage provided above and scroll to the bottom of the page which initiates loading of additional images . Then you see the new images are just appended to the container by jQuery . But they are not appended to the isotope layout instance as they are supposed to.The problematic part lays in a custom function named isotopeAppend ( ) . This function is called on page load and then the second part of 'if-else ' statement is executed . When initialization is done and first images are added to the container then the next time isotopeAppend ( ) is called ( it 's when user reaches to the bottom of the page ) the first part of 'if-else ' statement is executed and this is where the problematic Isotope 'appended ' method is called.A code snippet below from problematic javascript code . The results of the ajax request to external resource are applied to the variable newElems . When adding an alert ( 'something ' ) or console.log inside the 'appended ' callback - nothing happens.Does the problem lay in Isotope itself or does it have anything to do with my coding error ?

"It seems as though I am finally understanding JavaScript inheritance and how it should be done properly . Here is my code : From what I understand , using Object.create to create your prototype object for inheritance is much better than using the new keyword .

In the Male constructor where I use Human.call ( this , eyes ) ; to call a super class , I have to pass eyes again in the Male constructor to pass it to the Human constructor . This seems like a pain , is there an easier way to do this ? How come sometimes I see code like Male.prototype = new Human ( ) ; ... This seems to be incorrect .

"I 'm moving some elements in the page using ng-repeat and CSS transitions . If I change the data array using unshift the list transitions nicely . ( In my application I 'm transitioning position as well as opacity . ) If , however , I use shift to update the array , the DOM is updated immediately with no transition . Here 's a demo of one approach , where all works as expected aside from the transitions . Compare the behavior when using the two buttons.Here 's another demo of an alternative approach , where the transitions work , but the array loses an element each time the function runs . The idea is that the user can cycle through the items in the array indefinitely and the CSS transitions occur in both directions .

Also , based on some reading I did I tried using track by item.id with no success . Thanks much ."

The problem is that marker is immediately created and can be used to invoke the callback , but some properties are not yet available.If I wait two seconds before trying to access the properties , it works just fine - this leads me to believe that the object is still asynchronously generating itself after being created.In this example the callback : yields the correct response .

"I have an HTML page roughly divided 30 % - 70 % into two vertical columns . The left column contains a chat feed ( handled via Node and Socket.io ) , and the right column contains an emscripten-generated canvas ( with the ID of canvas ) . The canvas contains a basic 3D world that the user can navigate using standard first-person controls ( WASD for movement , mouse to 'look ' ) .By default , the canvas swallows all keyboard events . I 've fixed this with the following code in the canvas initialisation procedure : This allow me to manually focus on the chat box , type a message , and submit it.The issue I 'm running into is that once the chat message has been submitted , I try and return focus to the canvas with the following code ( to allow the players to navigate the 3d world with WASD ) : This nominally returns focus to the canvas , but mouse and keyboard movement does not work . Oddly , clicking off the tab/browser window and then into the canvas seems to work - focus is returned to the canvas , and I can navigate once more . Manually calling $ ( window ) .blur ( ) .focus ( ) does n't do the trick.Does anyone know how to force focus back to the canvas once a chat message has been sent ? -- UPDATE -- I 've added a text input field ( with the ID of hiddenField ) behind the canvas and I 'm using the preRun function to assign key events for the canvas to that field ( canvas was n't working consistently for some reason ) . This works fine until the user clicks off the canvas - for example , into the chat field - whereupon the canvas stops responding to any keyboard or mouse input , even though I 'm triggering focus back onto the hiddenField ( and can see that it 's getting it ) .It seems that doing anything on the page conflicts with emscripten 's focussing behaviour ( tied to the window object , I believe ) and prevents the canvas from regaining focus.Surely there 's some way of aloowing the emscripten canvas to live alongside other HTML elements ?"

"Context : Say I 've got an object , obj , with some methods and some getters : obj is chainable and the chains will regularly include both methods and getters : obj.method2 ( a , b ) .getter1.method1 ( a ) .getter2 ( for example ) .I understand that this chained usage of getters is a bit strange and probably inadvisable in most cases , but this is n't a regular js application ( it 's for a DSL ) .But what if ( for some reason ) we wanted to execute these chained methods/getters really lazily ? Like , only execute them when a certain `` final '' getter/method is called ?

"I 'm working on a jQuery plugin . When the plugin runs , the first thing it does is determine its settings . It does this by taking some default settings and overriding some or all of them with whatever the user passed in.Here 's a simplified version : So , if you call the plugin like this : ... you override the default alerter function , but use the default favoriteColor.I 'm defining the defaults outside the plugin itself so that they are publicly accessible . So if you want to change the default value for favoriteColor , you can just do this : ... and that will change it for every instance on the page after that.All of this works fine.Here 's my problem : in one of the default functions , I need to refer to settings . Something like this : But when I try this , I get a Javascript error on the line where the default alerter function is declared : `` settings is not defined . '' True enough : it 's not defined yet when the parser hits that line . It WILL be defined by the time the function runs , but that does n't seem to matter.So my question is : How can I import my default function into the plugin in such a way that it has access to settings ? Is there a way to delay evaluation of settings until the function is actually called ? If so , is there a way to make sure it has access to the local scope of the plugin , even though I assume that , as an object , this function is being passed by reference ? I know that I can alter the value of this inside a function by using someFunction.call ( valueToUseForThis ) , but I do n't know whether I can alter its scope after the fact.Some Stuff that Does n't WorkInitially , it seemed that if I declared settings in the outer , self-executing function , that would make it available to the defaults .

The author may or may not exist , so I need to : Check if the author is present in the DBIf it is , use this IDOtherwise , insert the author and use the new IDHowever , the above operations are also all asynchronous.I can just use a promise within the original map ( fetch and/or insert ID ) as a prerequisite of the insert operation . But the problem here is that , because everything 's ran asynchronously , the code may well insert duplicate authors because the initial check-if-author-exists is decoupled from the insert-a-new-author block.I can think of a few ways to achieve the above but they all involve splitting up the promise chain and generally seem a bit messy . This seems like the kind of problem that must arise quite commonly . I 'm sure I 'm missing something fundamental here ! Any tips ?"

I was implementing dynamic components for one of my project . The concept of dynamic components is that they come into the memory once they are needed and they have no reference in any template.According to the official docs we declare such components in entryComponents to prevent them from getting discarded in the tree shaking process as they have no template reference.Following is the app.module.ts where I have declared my two dynamic components SlideOneComponent and SlideTwoComponent in the entryComponents array : With above app.module.ts I am getting following error : The above error fades away as soon as I add my both dynamic components to declarations array .

"I 've been experimenting with jank-free rendering of complex scenes on HTML5 canvas . The idea is to split rendering into multiple batches with each batch taking a maximum of , say 12 ms , so that the concurrently running animations ( very cheap to execute ) are not interrupted . Conceptually , batch-rendering is implemented like this : The complete code is in this JSFiddle : https : //jsfiddle.net/fkfnjrc2/5/ . The code does the following things : On each frame , modify the CSS transform property of the canvas ( which is an example of the concurrently-running fast-to-execute animation ) .Once in a while , initiate re-rendering of the canvas in the batched fashion as shown above.Unfortunately , I 'm seeing horrible janks exactly at the times when canvas contents is re-rendered . What I do n't seem to be able to explain is what the Chrome Developer Tools timeline looks like : The dropped frames seem to be caused by the fact that the requestAnimationFrame is not called right at the start of the frame , but towards the end of the ideal 16ms period . If the callback started right after the previous frame completed rendering , the code would most likely complete in time.Rendering to an off-screen canvas ( https : //jsfiddle.net/fkfnjrc2/6/ ) and then copying the complete image to the screen canvas helps a little , but the janks are still there with exactly the same characteristics ( delayed execution of rAF callback ) .What is wrong with that code ?

"This question has come out of another , which concerns the behaviour of console.dir with string literals . In particular , see the comments on my answer.As we all know , String objects in JavaScript have a number of methods . Those methods are defined on the String.prototype object . String.prototype.toUpperCase for example . We can therefore do things like this : However , we can also do this : Clearly , the JavaScript interpreter is doing some form of conversion/cast when you call a method of String.prototype on a string literal . However , I ca n't find any reference to this in the spec . It makes sense , because otherwise you 'd have to explicity cast every string literal to a String object before you could use any of the methods , and that would be quite annoying.So my question is , where is this functionality described , and am I right in assuming the literal value is temporarily cast to an instance of String ?

"In javascript , division by zero with `` integer '' arguments acts like floating points should : The asm.js spec says that division with integer arguments returns intish , which must be immediately coerced to signed or unsigned . If we do this in javascript , division by zero with `` integer '' arguments always returns zero after coersion : However , in languages with actual integer types like Java and C , dividing an integer by zero is an error and execution halts somehow ( e.g. , throws exception , triggers a trap , etc ) .This also seems to violate the type signatures specified by asm.js . The type of Infinity and NaN is double and of / is supposedly ( from the spec ) : ( signed , signed ) → intish ∧ ( unsigned , unsigned ) → intish ∧ ( double ? , double ? ) → double ∧ ( float ? , float ? ) → floatishHowever if any of these has a zero denominator , the result is double , so it seems like the type can only be : ( double ? , double ? ) → doubleWhat is expected to happen in asm.js code ? Does it follow javascript and return 0 or does divide-by-zero produce a runtime error ? If it follows javascript , why is it ok that the typing is wrong ? If it produces a runtime error , why does n't the spec mention it ?"

"I 've been wondering whether using prototypes in JavaScript should be more memory efficient than attaching every member of an object directly to it for the following reasons : The prototype is just one single object.The instances hold only references to their prototype.Versus : Every instance holds a copy of all the members and methods that are defined by the constructor.I started a little experiment with this : randomString ( x ) just produces a , well , random String of length x.I then instantiated the objects in large quantities like this : and checked the memory usage of the browser process ( Google Chrome ) . I know , that 's not very exact ... However , in both cases the memory usage went up significantly as expected ( about 30 MB for TestObjectFat ) , but the prototype variant used not much less memory ( about 26 MB for TestObjectThin ) .I also checked that the TestObjectThin instances contain the same string in their `` text '' property , so they are really using the property of the prototype.Now , I 'm not so sure what to think about this . The prototyping does n't seem to be the big memory saver at all.I know that prototyping is a great idea for many other reasons , but I 'm specifically concerned with memory usage here . Any explanations why the prototype variant uses almost the same amount of memory ? Am I missing something ?"

"This is my array of objectsThe result should be like thisSo I want to get rid of the sub array in property key3 and get the new equivalent structure , copying all the other properties.For reasons I can not change I am supposed to use lodash , but only in version 2.4.2EDIT : To be more elaborate : I am using a JSON based form engine which allows to use existing functions ( like lodash functions ) but does n't allow to define new functions . I also can not use control structures like for loops . Essentially I can only use chained basic function calls including lodash.I tried to use map , but map can not extend an array , it can only convert one array element into something differentIs there any lodash magic I can use here ?

"I 'm creating a presentation with RevealJS and would like to incorporate some interactive SVG visualizations created with D3 . I 've done this without difficulty a number of times before but I 'm having some difficulty this time . After a bit of debugging , I 've traced the problem to the following : For some reason , the mouse position relative to an SVG is not reported correctly when the whole thing is wrapped inside RevealJS.My original version of the code used a standard D3 technique to get the mouse position . In an effort to simplify and isolate the problem , though , I eliminated D3 and now use vanilla Javascript to get the mouse position as detailed in this StackOverflow answer . My code ( implemented as a stack-snippet ) looks like so : When I run it inside RevealJS in Firefox on my Mac , though , I get very different numbers - as if the coordinates have been shifted by ( -423 , -321 ) or some other large negative pair of numbers . I 've added a screen shot below to illustrate this . The mouse does n't appear in the screenshot but is near the upper left corner so that it should read something like ( 3,5 ) or some small values like that.I assume that RevealJS is performing some extra transformation on the SVG , but I ca n't find it and I 'm hoping there 's some RevealJS recommended way to deal with this.There is a full working ( well , not actually correctly ) version of the RevealJS version here . It 's pretty much the exact same code as in the stack-snippet above , but wrapped inside a minimal RevealJS template.Looking into this more closely still , the issue appears to happen with Firefox but not with Chrome . I 'm running current versions of those programs on my 1 year old Macbook Pro .

"In the context of a user script , for example executed by Tampermonkey , is it possible to communicate between two pages of different domains , which set ' X-Frame-Options ' to 'SAMEORIGIN ' ?

But I thought since I 'm able to insert script in both pages , it might be possible to pull off some workaround or alternate solution . One suggestion , a shared worker looked promising , but it seems to require the page to be from the same origin . Also I looked at the Broadcast Channel API spec , but it is n't implemented anywhere yet , and it also seems to be bound to the same origin policy . Another suggested possibility mentioned so far in the comments is to use the GM API since this is a user-script ( extended / special JS features ) . With GM_xmlhttpRequest we can ignore cross domain restrictions and load google.com , then put it in an iframe , but all the sources will point to the site where the iframe is embedded , so searching the Google page tries to execute the search params on the parent site 's domain . Maybe I could edit the search requests to point to google.com specifically , rather than letting the search adopt the parent page 's domain . And if that fails due to some hangup with the same origin policy , I could even try to replace Google 's xmlhttpRequest 's with GM_xmlhttpRequest 's , but I 'm not sure if that can be done since the user script , if you load GM functions , will run in a sandbox , unable to intertwine with the pages scripts if I understand correctly . I 'm just not sure.On the other hand , if we can trick the iframe 's contents to treat google.com as the domain for requests , though we 're in business , but examples do n't seem to exist for this kind of thing , so I 'm having trouble figuring out how to make it happen ."

I 'm trying to emulate Scala 's sealed case classes in Flow by using disjoint unions : I should get a type error for case 'TOGGGGLE_TODO ' : but I don't.Is there a way to fix that ? EDIT : I paste here the code from Gabriele 's comment for future-proof-ness :
"NOTE : When I say the regex [ \0 ] I mean the regex [ \0 ] ( not contained in a C-style string , which would then be `` [ \\0 ] '' ) . If I have n't put quotes around it , it 's not a C-style string , and the backslashes should n't be interpreted as escaping a C-style string.Inspired by this question and my investigation , I tried the following code in clang 3.4 : Apparently , clang does n't like this , as it throws : std : :__1 : :regex_error : The expression contained an invalid escaped character , or a trailing escape.It seems to be the [ ^\0 ] part ( changing it to [ ^\n ] or something similar works fine ) . It seems to be an invalid escape character . I want to clarify that I 'm not talking about the '\0 ' character ( null-character ) or '\n ' character ( newline character ) . In C-style strings , what I 'm talking about is `` \\0 '' ( a string containing backslash zero ) and `` \\n '' ( a string containing backslash n ) . `` \\n '' seems to get transformed into `` \n '' by the regex engine , but it chokes on `` \\0 '' .The C++11 standard says in section 28.13 [ re.grammar ] that : The regular expression grammar recognized by basic_regex objects constructed with the ECMAScript flag is that specified by ECMA-262 , except as specified below.I 'm no expert on ECMA-262 , but I tried the regular expression on JSFiddle and it 's working fine there in JavaScript land.So now I 'm wondering if the regex [ ^\0 ] is valid in ECMA-262 and the C++11 standard removed support for it ( in the stuff following ... except as specified below . ) .Question : Is the \0 ( not the null-character ; in a string literal this would be `` \\0 '' ) escape sequence legal in a C++11 regular expression ? Is it legal in ECMA-262 ( or are browser JS VMs just being `` too '' lenient ) ? What 's the cause/justification for the different behaviors ?"

"SummarySee the toy example Azure notebook hosted at this link . The notebook can be cloned and run , or downloaded and run locally , from there , but all of the code is also below for convenience.When all the cells are run , the javascript console reports these errors ( abbreviated ) in the final cell , and the final expected line of output does not render : Not sure where I am going wrong.UPDATE : As it currently exists , the code sends a string instance ( rather than a DOMWidgetModel instance ) to the create_child_view method . The string contains `` IPY_MODEL_ '' appended by the model id . This seems like it might be the root of the problem . That string instance is being received by the client from the server side Backbone children model array items ( this.model.get ( 'children ' ) ) .I am wondering if the problem is related to the [ de ] serialization of widgets discussed in the low-level widget tutorial . But I 'm not sure how to use that to fix this problem , since I need access to the sub widget model itself and not just an attribute . And I believe I am correctly passing the **widgets.widget_serialization as the tutorial specifies.DetailsThe notebook contains python and javascript code , and utilizes the ipywidgets library , which relies heavily on Backbone . The back end code ( python , cell # 1 ) creates a ipywidgets.DOMWidget subclass widget , Test ( a Backbone model mirrored in the front end ) . The front end code ( javascript , cell # 2 ) creates a ipywidgets.DOMWidgetView subclass , TestView , which is instantiated by the widget when it is rendered to the page.The Test model widget has a children member made up of multiple `` sub-widgets '' ( which are also models ) . These widgets are instances of the python class Sub . When a view of Test is rendered , I want to instantiate and render the views of the children widgets and attach them to the view of the parent Test widget ( note : that final part has n't been implemented yet below ) .The problem is that when I try to follow the ipywidgets API to create children views , populating the ViewList array by instantiating the children views using the create_child_view method on each child model is not working.The API for this kind of thing is n't particularly well documented , so I 'm doing my best to follow various similar examples of how to instantiate sub-views using child models from within a parent view , such as the parent widgets in ipywidgets itself and in ipyleaflet . But nothing I do seems to get the creation of children views working.Note that I am able to render a view of each Sub widget individually without any problem . It is only when I try to use the create_child_view method to create a view from within the parent Test widget that we run into problems.CodeCell 1 ( server side jupyter python kernel ) Cell 2 ( front end jupyter notebook code ) Cell 3 ( python code for testing ) OutputCurrent output : Expected output : More specific information about the actual project I am working on is at this github issue if anyone is interested ."

"I 've been reading up on global namespace pollution when developing an extension for Firefox , and I want to avoid it as much as possible in my extension . There are several solutions , but generally , the solutions seem to center around only declaring one global variable for your extension , and putting everything in that . Thus you only add one extra variable to the global namespace , which is n't too bad.As a brief aside , I have had a solution proposed to me that avoids putting any extra variables into the global namespace ; wrap everything in a function . The problem here is that there 's nothing to refer to in your XUL overlays . You have to declare elements in your overlays , and then in JS add a ton of addEventListeners to replace what would 've been something like an oncommand= '' ... '' in XUL . I do n't want to do this ; I definitely want my XUL to include events in the XUL itself because I think it looks cleaner , so this is n't a solution for me . I therefore need at least 1 global variable for XUL oncommand= '' ... '' attributes to refer to.So the consensus seems to be to have one ( and only one ) variable for your extension , and put all your code inside that . Here 's the problem : generally , people recommend that that variable be named a nice long , unique name so as to have almost zero chance of colliding with other variables . So if my extension 's ID is myextension @ mycompany.com , I could name my variable myextensionAtMycompanyDotCom , or com.mycompany.myextension . This is good for avoiding collisions in the global namespace , but there 's one problem ; that variable name is long and unwieldy . My XUL is going to be littered with references to event handlers along the lines of oncommand= '' myextensionAtMycompanyDotCom.doSomeEvent '' . There 's no way to avoid having to refer to the global namespace in my XUL overlays , because an overlay just gets added to the browser window 's DOM ; it does n't have a namespace of its own , so we ca n't somehow limit our extension 's variable scope only to our own overlays . So , as I see it , there are four solutions:1 . Just use the long variable name in XULThis results in rather unwieldy , verbose XUL code like:2 . Add an element of randomness to a short variable nameWe come up with a much nicer short variable name for our extension , let 's say myExt , and add some random characters on to make it almost certainly unique , such as myExtAX8T9 . Then in the XUL , we have : Clearly , this results in rather ugly and even confusing code as the random characters look odd , and make it look like some kind of temporary variable.3 . Do n't declare any global variables at allYou could just wrap up everything in functions . This , of course , means that there is nothing to refer to in your XUL , and so every event must be attached to the XUL elements using addEventListener in your JavaScript code . I do n't like this solution because , as mentioned above , I think it 's cleaner to have the events referenced in the XUL code rather than having to search a ton of JS code to find which events are attached to which XUL elements.4 . Just use a short variable name in XULI could just call my extension 's variable myExt , and then I get nice XUL code like : Of course , this short name is much more likely to clash with something else in the global namespace and so is n't ideal.So , have I missed something ? Is there any alternative to the 4 solutions I proposed above ? If not , what would be the best of the 4 ( given that # 3 is basically unacceptable to me ) , and why ?"

If you want to test it yourself , react-with-addons.js came from the starter kit hereEDIT : I tried adding button to the code to see if I could click on that , and I can . I can click on it with out triggering the tweet itself . This means there is something specific to the input box that is causing trouble , or there is something in the button that is blocking propagation of the click . Is there something special triggered when you click on an input field that other elements do n't have that the tweets might have ? EDIT 2 : I have now tried to add stopPropagation to a containing div and increasing it 's z-index , neither of them will stop it . EDIT 3 : I have now tried onMouseDown ( and onMouseUp , and onClick , all at the same time ) with stopPropagation , with no luck . The strange part is I tried isPropagationStopped ( ) afterwards , and it returns true . If this is so then why is Twitter still being triggered ? test_input.jsmanifest.json"

"I am sending an AJAX POST request using jQuery on a chrome extension but the data does n't arrive as expected , accented characters turn out malformed.The text `` HÄGERSTEN '' becomes `` HÃ „ GERSTEN '' .The text appears fine in the console etc , only via AJAX to this other page it appears as mentioned . My AJAX call is basic , I send a data-object via jQuery $ .ajax . I 've tried both with and without contentType , UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 . No difference.This is how I make my AJAX call : The newValues object has more values but I retrieve them from a form . However , I have tried to specify these values manually as newValues [ 'name ' ] = 'ÄÄÄÄ ' ; and still would cause the same problem . The original form element of the page that I am sending the AJAX to contains attribute accept-charset= '' iso-8859-1 '' . Maybe this matters . The target website is using Servlet/2.5 JSP/2.1 . Just incase it might make a difference.I assume this is an encoding issue and as I 've understood it should be because Chrome extensions require the script files to be UTF-8 encoded which probably conflicts with the website the plugin is running on and the target AJAX page ( same website ) which is using an ISO-8859-1 encoding , however I have no idea how to deal with it . I have tried several methods of decoding/encoding it to and from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1 and other tricks with no success.I have tried using encodeURIComponent on my values which only makes them show that way exactly on the form that displays the values I have sent via POST , as e.g . H % C3 % 84GERSTEN.I have no access to the websites server and can not tell you whether this is a problem from their side , however I would not suppose so.UPDATENow I have understood POST data must be sent as UTF-8 !

Taking the regex from that question and modifying it a bit : ( I know that * is redundant here , but I found what 's following to be quite an interesting behaviour ) .And if we try to match against : I expected to get the first capture group to be empty , because ( .* ? ) is lazy and will stop at the first ] it comes across . This is indeed what happens in : PCREPythonbut not Javascript where it matches the whole ] [ ] [ . ( jsfiddle ) I looked around with some other languages , for instance ruby , java , C # but all behave like I expected them to ( i.e . return empty capture groups ) . ( regexplanet 's golang flavour apparently also gets non-empty capture groups ) It seems that JavaScript 's regex engine is interpreting the second * to convert .* ? from lazy to greedy . Note that converting the second * to * ? seems to make the regex work as I expected ( as does removing the quantifier completely , because I know that it 's being redundant in this situation , but that 's not the point ) . * was used in the regex , but this behaviour is similar with + , ? or { m , n } and converting them to their lazy version gives the same results as with * ? .Does anyone know what 's really happening ?"

"I 'm trying to define the global object in JavaScript in a single line as follows : The above statement is in the global scope .

"I 've generalized my lack of understanding of the situation to this small problem . Here 's what I think I know so far : I have an object myDog ( a global variable ) . Dog has a member variable el that is an html element ; because it 's an element , I can add event listeners to it . So , when you click on myDog.el , it logs to the console the values of this.name and myDog.name . As expected because of scope , this.name is undefined and myDog.name is 'tye ' . this inside of Dog.speak when invoked by the click event listener refers to the element that was clicked , the member variable el , not the object Dog . Since myDog is a global variable , it 's able to pick back up regardless of the function 's scope and get to myDog.name just fine.See code below : So ... my questions are1 ) What are some strategies for attaching objects to html elements , so that I can go from this.el back to myDog ( this.el 's owner ) without myDog being a global variable ? 2 ) Are global variables in this case a necessary evil ?

Lets say I have an array of promises . Each element of my array is a knex.js query builder and is ready to be executed and returns a promise.How can I run each element of this array sequentially.The array is built dynamically.Each q is not a promise by itself but it will return a promise upon execution .
"If I have an array that I want to be of fixed size N for the purpose of caching the most recent of N items , then once limit N is reached , I 'll have to get rid of the oldest item while adding the newest item.Note : I do n't care if the newest item is at the beginning or end of the array , just as long as the items get removed in the order that they are added.The obvious ways are either : push ( ) and shift ( ) ( so that cache [ 0 ] contains the oldest item ) , orunshift ( ) and pop ( ) ( so that cache [ 0 ] contains the newest item ) Basic idea : However , I 've read about memory issues with shift and unshift since they alter the beginning of the array and move everything else around , but unfortunately , one of those methods has to be used to do it this way ! Qs : Are there other ways to do this that would be better performance-wise ? If the two ways I already mentioned are the best , are there specific advantages/disadvantages I need to be aware of ? ConclusionAfter doing some more research into data structures ( I 've never programmed in other languages , so if it 's not native to Javascript , I likely have n't heard of it ! ) and doing a bunch of benchmarking in multiple browsers with both small and large arrays as well as small and large numbers of reads / writes , here 's what I found : The 'circular buffer ' method proposed by Bergi is hands-down THE best as far performance ( for reasons explained in the answer and comments ) , and hence it has been accepted as the answer . However , it 's not as intuitive , and makes it difficult to write your own 'extra ' functions ( since you always have to take offset into account ) . If you 're going to use this method , I recommend an already-created one like this circular buffer on GitHub.The 'pop/unpush ' method is much more intuitive , and performs fairly well , accept at the most extreme numbers.The 'copyWithin ' method is , sadly , terrible for performance ( tested in multiple browsers ) , quickly creating unacceptable latency . It also has no IE support . It 's such a simple method ! I wish it worked better.The 'linked list ' method , proposed in the comments by Felix Kling , is actually a really good option . I initially disregarded it because it seemed like a lot of extra stuff I did n't need , but to my surprise ... .What I actually needed was a Least Recently Used ( LRU ) Map ( which employs a doubly-linked list ) . Now , since I did n't specify my additional requirements in my original question , I 'm still marking Bergi 's answer as the best answer to that specific question . However , since I needed to know if a value already existed in my cache , and if so , mark it as the newest item in the cache , the additional logic I had to add to my circular buffer 's add ( ) method ( primarily indexOf ( ) ) made it not much more efficient than the 'pop/unpush ' method . HOWEVER , the performance of the LRUMap in these situations blew both of the other two out of the water ! So to summarize : Linked List -- most options while still maintaining great performanceCircular Buffer -- best performance for just adding and gettingPop / Unpush -- most intuitive and simplestcopyWithin -- terrible performance currently , no reason to use"

"I am looking for a descriptive way to document the used data structures in my JavaScript application . I find it hard to get this done due to the dynamic character of JavaScript.For instance , what could be a good way to tell , that a used variable distance is a two-dimensional array with length i and j and stores numbers between -1 and MAX_INT . I could think of something like this : What about an object which is used as a map/dictionary for certain data types , what about a two-dimensional array where the first element of an array defines other data then the rest , etc.Of course , it is always possible to document these things in a text , I just thought , maybe there is a well known and used way to do this in a semiformal way ."

"I am working on a very time-sensitive web application . One of the business rules given to me is that the application 's behavior must always depend on the time on the web server , regardless of what time is on the client 's clock . To make this clear to the user , I was asked to display the server 's time in the web application.To this end , I wrote the following Javascript code : The function passed in for updateDisplayCallback is a simple function to display the date on the web page.The basic idea is that the Javascript makes an asynchronous call to look up the server 's time , store it on the client , and then update it once per second.At first , this appears to work , but as time goes by , the displayed time gets behind a few seconds every minute . I left it running overnight , and when I came in the next morning , it was off by more than an hour ! This is entirely unacceptable because the web application may be kept open for days at a time.How can I modify this code so that the web browser will continuously and accurately display the server 's time ?"

"I encountered a very strange behaviour in php-html-mixed code .

There are placeholders in my textarea over which I display my divs ( tokens ) . When you navigate to one of them , cursor jumps to the opposite edge of a placeholder , so it feels natural .

"We 're using Backbone.Router in a pushstate-only mode , so all our client routes are hash-less.However , we 're facing a difficulty with implementing modal views in our app.The challenge is the following : We want Back button to hide the current modal view ( so we need it to have a URL ) ; We want Forward to show it again without redrawing the whole app ; We want to be able to show modals “ on top of ” any existing route and not just on one page ; We want to be able to make links that immediately show a specific modal ( such as login modal view ) .In other words , we want modal views to be represented in history.Our first attempt was to use URL like /login for login modal and handle them specifically in route handler . When we 're on /otherpage , opening modal would navigate to /login , and , when modal is closed , navigate again to /otherpage.However , this has a very major problem : URL like /login does n't “ know ” over which view it should be drawn , so we have to redraw everything when pressing Back and Forward.This actually makes sense : Login modal over Home screen should have different URL from Login modal over Other Page.My second thought was that maybe we can use hashes for indicating current modal view : This makes the routing handler simple : First , draw the actual views based on matched route , just like we did before.After that , if hash is present , display a modal view on top.This also fits with the idea of hash being a “ fragment ” of the visible document . ( Yes , apps are not documents , bla bla bla . We still want them to be addressable . ) Are there any inherent problems in this approach ? Is there a better approach satisfying our conditions ?"

"I 've created an app using jQuery Mobile ( 1.3.1 ) and PhoneGap ( 3.4 ) , and have skinned it to have a fairly `` flat '' looking interface : I 'm having some trouble where , only on iOS , and only occasionally , the `` back '' button on only one certain screen becomes unresponsive . The same HTML & CSS for the back button on other screens seems fine , it 's just this one screen . Here it is in chrome with the button selected in devtools to highlight its hit area : And just for good measure , here 's the header as well : The code for this screen 's header is the same for just about every screen in the app : We 've found that , should the user get stuck on this screen and force-close the app , the button seems to work as expected in subsequent use.So my current theory is that the header is somehow getting in the way of the back button ( sometimes ) . The fact that it 's not every time makes me not really believe this theory completely , however.The button has its z-index set to 10 and the header 's z-index is left at the default ( which is 1 , correct ? ) . So even if it were the header getting in the way , my understanding is that the z-index of 10 should put the button `` on top '' and give it the first opportunity to receive the click/tap event.The app uses jQueryMobile 1.3.1 because of the timing of when and how it was created , and upgrading is not a reasonable option at this moment . ( There have been a significant number of breaking changes in 1.4.x ) I have debugged the app on both iOS and Android and no JavaScript errors are thrown . I 'm at a total loss for what to do . This app is in the process of rolling out to thousands of users and there 's a high likelihood that many , possibly most , will run into this bug . I would rather not have to explain ( with my tail between my legs ) that force-closing is the only way to fix this ... but that 's what I 've been doing so far.Does anyone have any advice or ideas on how to fix this ? Update 1 : I 've noticed while remote-debugging the app in Safari over USB that I can watch the classes on the back button change , when tapped , from ui-btn-up-e to ui-btn-hover-e briefly to ui-btn-down-e and back to ui-btn-up-e -- and yet the app is not going back ! : ( And as requested , here is the CSS applied to the header , the H1 , and the back button : ( just the `` computed '' final values , not all of the intermediary overridden values ) header div : H1 : Back button :"
"When users click the share button on our paywalled site , we generate a token via an async call that allows the people clicking on the share link to bypass the paywall.I 've added support for Web Share API first calling the token before triggering navigator.share - along these lines : This is working fine on Chrome / Android which supports Web Share . However on Safari , I am getting a not allowed error . The request is not allowed by the user agent or the platform in the current context , possibly because the user denied permission ( This only happens on the first share attempt as I save the response to the window and therefore on subsequent clicks it avoids the AJAX call and works just fine . ) Because of the number of readers we have and the small number that actually use the share option , it would be expensive to make the AJAX call for ever page load ( vs. only when user expresses intent to share ) .Being that this works fine in Chrome I am assuming nothing in the spec prohibits an AJAX call before launching Web Share.Might this be a bug in Safari 's implementation ? Or the reverse and actually Chrome should n't be allowing ? Example : https : //mkonikov.com/web-share-testing/I 've added a toggle to share with or without fetching first . This share fails only when fetch is enabled .

"I am writing a React ( ES6 , v16 ) ( typescript ) application with react-router v4 . I am observing a very strange behavior . Here is my render code ( very much simplified ) : And here is the FormEntry component ( simplified ) : Now when , inside the application , I click a link `` /foo/add '' , the handler in the first `` Route '' component is fired ( as expected ) and the component `` FormEntry '' is mounted . The method componentDidMount is rightfully fired . Now I click the link `` foo/edit/1 '' . The handler of the second Route is fired . This time , inside the `` FormEntry '' component , the lifecycle method `` componentDidMount '' is not fired , the method `` componentDidUpdate '' is called . But this is cleary a different `` instance '' of the FormEntry which is being mounted . I was expecting the see of the lifecycle methods kicked off ... It looks like there is only one instance of `` FormEntry '' in my application . So why in the second case ( when Route handler for url `` foo/edit : id '' ) this instance does not go through the all lifecycle methods ? ? Is it a breaking change in the v16 version of React ? ( I have not observed this behavior in previous versions of react ) .Your insight will be very much appreciated"

"Today I happened to have too much time to kill and I played a bit with the Node ( v0.10.13 ) command line : Now , according to MDN , what instanceof does is : The instanceof operator tests whether an object has in its prototype chain the prototype property of a constructor.But clearly Object.prototype IS in 1 's prototype chain .

I was looking at some tutorial on React Hooks and in the tutorial the author created a useDropdown hook for rendering reusable dropdowns . The code is like thisand he used this in a component like thisHe said this way we can create reusable dropdown components . I was wondering how is this different from defining a plain old Dropdown component and pass props into it . The only difference I can think of in this case is that now we have the ability to get the state and setState in the parent component ( i.e . SomeComponent ) and read / set the state of the child ( i.e . the component output by useDropdown ) directly from there . However is this considered an anti-pattern since we are breaking the one way data flow ?

"The behavior I 'm about to describe happens in Chrome 44 , but does not happen in Firefox 40.If you create an oscillator , set it to a frequency of 220 Hz , and then change the frequency to 440 Hz a second later , you can hear a distinct portamento effect : instead of changing instantly from 220 to 440 , the oscillator glides from the original frequency to the new one.The code below illustrates this phenomenon : I 've examined the docs for the OscillatorNode object , and there 's no mention of this behavior .

"What I want to happen : For testing a game art style I thought of , I want to render a 3D world in pixel-art form . So for example , take a scene like this ( but rendered with certain coloring / style so as to look good once pixelated ) : And make it look something like this : By playing with different ways of styling the 3D source I think the pixelated output could look nice . Of course to get this effect one just sizes the image down to ~80p and upscales it to 1080p with nearest neighbor resampling . But it 's more efficient to render straight to an 80p canvas to begin with and just do the upscaling.This is not typically how one would use a shader , to resize a bitmap in nearest neighbor format , but the performance on it is better than any other way I 've found to make such a conversion in real time.My code : My buffer for the bitmap is stored in row major , as r1 , g1 , b1 , a1 , r2 , g2 , b2 , a2 ... and I 'm using gpu.js which essentially converts this JS func into a shader . My goal is to take one bitmap and return one at larger scale with nearest-neighbor scaling , so each pixel becomes a 2x2 square or 3x3 and so on . Assume inputBuffer is a scaled fraction of size of the output determined by the setOutput method.JSFiddle Keep in mind it 's iterating over a new buffer of the full size output , so I have to find the correct coordinates that will exist in the smaller sourceBuffer based on the current index in the outputBuffer ( index is exposed by the lib as this.thread.x ) .What 's happening instead : This , instead of making a nearest neighbor upscale , is making a nice little rainbow ( above is the small normal render , below is the result of the shader , and to the right you can see some debug logging with stats about the input and output buffers ) : What am I doing wrong ? Note : I asked a related question here , Is there a simpler ( and still performant ) way to upscale a canvas render with nearest neighbor resampling ?"

"I 'm building a browser game and im using a heavy amount of ajax instead of page refreshs . I 'm using php and javascript . After alot of work i noticed that ajax isnt exactly secure . The threats im worried about is say someone wants to look up someones information on my SQL server they 'd just need to key in right information to my .php file associated with my ajax calls . I was using GET style ajax calls which was a bad idea . Anyways after alot of research i have the following security measures in place . I switched to POST ( which isnt really any more secure but its a minor deterent ) . I have a referred in place as well which again can be faked but again its another deterrent . The final measure i have in place and is the focus of this question , when my website is loaded i have a 80 char hex key generated and saved in the session , and when im sending the ajax call i am also sending the challenge key in the form of now when the ajax php file reads this it checks to see if the sent challenge matchs the session challenge . Now this by itself wouldnt do much because you can simply open up firebug and see what challenge is being sent easily . So what I 'm having it do is once that challenge is used it generates a new one in the session.So my question is how secure is this from where im standing it looks one could only see what the challenge key was after it was sent and then it renews and they couldnt see it again until it is sent , making it not possible to send a faked request from another source . So does anyone see any loop hole to this security method or have any addition thoughts or ideas ."

"I have a function in search of a name.I 've been building a new functional programming library in Javascript , and I recently added a new function that looks useful to me . I named it useWith but I 'm wondering if it 's a function already known to functional programmers under a different name.The function is related to compose in that it returns a new function that combines several existing ones , but in a slightly different manner than compose . The first parameter it receives is singled out ; the remainder are treated uniformly . When the returned function is called , the arguments are passed respectively to each of these remaining functions , and the results , along with any unpaired arguments are sent to that first function , whose result is then returned . So if this is called with only two functions , and if the resulting function is passed a single argument , this is exactly equivalent to compose . But it has some additional features for multiple arguments.The reason I wanted this function was that I was implementing something like the project functionMichal Fogus presented in Functional Javascript , an equivalent of Codd 's project for an array of similar Javascript objects , and similar to SQL 's select verb . It is quite easy to write like this : But I really wanted to implement it in a points-free style . But of course this would n't work : ... because there is no facility to pass through the second parameter , table inside compose.That 's where this new function comes in : I made it more generic than this case , though . The original approach was called using with the parameters reversed , so that it read as a command : `` Using pick , map '' . But that made it hard to extend to multiple parameters . I 'd have to make the first one an array , or allow it to be either an array or a single function , and I did n't really want to go there . This seemed a much better solution.I feel as though I ca n't be the first person with the need for a function like this . Is this a common pattern in FP languages ? Is there a common name for this function ? If not , are there suggestions for a better name than useWith ? If you 're curious , here 's the implementation of useWith , using a pretty obvious slice , and a fairly standard curry :"

"I have an < input > and a < button > .The input has an onblur event handler that ( sometimes ) results in the < button > being moved ; if , with focus on the < input > , the user goes to click on the < button > ( and it is thereby moved from beneath the pointer before the click completes ) they must currently move their pointer to the button 's new location and click it a second time . This experience is suboptimal.I would like for users to have to click the < button > only once ( but must retain the functionality of the button moving when the < input > loses focus ) . However , if a user mousedowns over the button and then moves their mouse pointer away ( includes switching focus from the application ) before mouseup , no click event should be triggered ( as normal ) .I ca n't see any approach based on handling onmousedown and/or onmouseup that would not be prone to errors in some edge cases . All that I can think is to forcibly move the cursor in the onblur handler so that the click completes ( if indeed it would ? ) —but this is probably a poor user experience too.How can this best be handled ?"

"I am building a React component library whose source code takes this general structure : My components are responsible for importing their own per-component styles ( using scss ) , so for example , button/index.js has this line : So far , in my application I have been consuming my library directly from source like this : When my application uses webpack , along with style-loader , the per-component css is appended as style tags in head dynamically when the component is first used . This is a nice performance win since the per-component styling does n't need to be parsed by the browser until it 's actually needed.Now though , I want to distribute my library using Rollup , so application consumers would do something like this : When I use rollup-plugin-scss it just bundles the per-component styles all together , not dynamically adding them as before.Is there a technique I can incorporate into my Rollup build so that my per-component styles are dynamically added as style tags in the head tag as they are used ?"

"The whole point of adding static types to JavaScript is to provide some guarantees about type safety . I noticed that array indexing seems to break type safety without using any dirty tricks like as any or the not null assertion operator.This code does not cause any TypeScript errors , even though it is plain to see that it will violate type safety . It seems to me that the type of an Array < T > acted upon by the index operator [ ] should be type T | undefined , however the TypeScript compiler treats it as if it was type T.Upon further investigation , I discovered that this behavior applies to use of the index operator on objects as well . It would seem that the index operator is not type safe in any case.Use of the index operator on an object with arbitrary key returns type any , which can be assigned to any type without causing type errors . However , this can be resolved by using the -- noImplicitAny compiler option.My question is why does something as basic as indexing on an array break type safety ? Is this a design constraint , an oversight , or a deliberate part of TypeScript ?"

When both the callstack and microtask queue are empty , the event loop starts taking callbacks from the task queue.When the button with the id btn is clicked , both `` click '' event listeners are placed on the task queue in order they are declared in.The event loop places the `` click-1 '' callback on the callstack . It has a promise that immediately resolves , placing the `` resolved-1 '' callback on the microtask queue.The `` click-1 '' callback executes its console.log , and completes . Now there 's something on the microtask queue , so the event loop takes the `` resolved-1 '' callback and places it on the callstack . `` resolved-1 '' callback is executed . Now both the callstack and microtask queue and are empty.The event loop then `` looks '' at the task queue once again , and the cycle repeats.This would explain this output from the code snippet aboveI would expect it to be the same then I programatically click the button with btn.click ( ) .However , the output is different.Why is there a difference in the execution order when button is programatically clicked ?"
"I 'm making a website with infinite scrolling . That is , as the user scrolls to the bottom of the page , a new block of content is appended to the bottom . It 's very similar to Facebook . Here 's an example of 3 pages loaded : When the user clicks something on the last page , I take them to a separate detail page . But if the user clicks back to the search results page , I have no memory of their previous location and must load page 0 again.I know of some old-school methods to solve this , but they each have some serious problems : Hash URLI could update the URL every time a new page is loaded . For example : www.website.com/page # 2 . When the user goes to the detail page and back , the URL tells me the last loaded page , so I load it for him : But this is poor user experience . Only page 2 is loaded . The user can not scroll up to see older content . I ca n't just load pages 0 , 1 , and 2 because that would overload the server , considering that the back button accounts for 50 % of web traffic ( Jacob Nielsen study ) . Local StorageCookies do n't have the storage capacity to store many pages of data . Local Storage should have sufficient space . One idea is to store all the loaded pages into Local Storage . When the user goes back to the search results , I load from local storage instead of hitting the server . The problem with this approach is that a large chunk of my users are on browsers that do n't support local storage ( IE7 ) ."

"In a Javascript function , are you required to define nested functions as function expressions or are function declarations allowed in a function body ? For example , would something like this be compliant ? Or would you have to do something like this ? ECMA-262 says that : Several widely used implementations of ECMAScript are known to support the use of FunctionDeclaration as a Statement . However there are significant and irreconcilable variations among the implementations in the semantics applied to such FunctionDeclarations . Because of these irreconcilable differences , the use of a FunctionDeclaration as a Statement results in code that is not reliably portable among implementations . It is recommended that ECMAScript implementations either disallow this usage of FunctionDeclaration or issue a warning when such a usage is encountered . Future editions of ECMAScript may define alternative portable means for declaring functions in a Statement context.Does this mean that a function declaration in a function body is technically incorrect , or have I got this completely wrong ? I 've heard people refer to the body as a block , which according to the standard , is one or more statements , but I 'm not sure ."

The difference being that in this case the state of the transition ( how far it has progressed ) is essential unlike in the aforementioned post that completely ignores it.TL ; DR : How to animate/transition an element back to it 's original state after animation ends ? Hello , I 'm trying to make animate panels so that they `` float '' when hovered . My problem is that the mouse leaves the panel , instead of transitioning back to it 's original state , it jumps instantly back . A heavily simplified version of this can be found in the snippet available below.As you can see , floating it triggers a smooth animation that resembles a floating motion , however , it is abruptly interrupted as the mouse leaves the box and the animation stops.So my question is : Is there a way to allow the box to transition back to it 's original state , preferably without using JavaScript ( although all suggestions are appreciated ) .

"I am trying to create a special kind of donut chart in D3 which will contain different rings for positive and negative values . The values can be greater than 100 % or less than -100 % so there will be an arc representing the remaining value .

The next positive category value ( Category_2 - Orange ) is 160 . So it is first using the 20 % left by Category_1 ( 140 value left now ) . Then it is filling the next circle ( upward ) 100 % ( 40 value left now ) , and for the remaining value ( 40 ) , it is creating partial-circle upward.Now , we have Category_3 ( dark-red ) as negative ( -120 % ) , so it if creating an inward circle and filling it 100 % ( 20 value left now ) , and then it is creating an inward arc for remaining value ( 20 ) .

Is it possible to listen to property changes without the use of Proxy and setInterval ? For common objects you could use the function below but that works for all existing properties but does n't work for any properties that might get added after the wrapping.If the object is an array you could also listen to the length property and reset all the get and set functions when it 's changed . This is obviously not very efficient as it changes the properties of each element whenever an element is added or removed.So I do n't think that Object.defineProperty is the answer.The reason I do n't want to use setInterval is because having big intervals will make the wrapping unreliable whereas having small intervals will have a big impact on the efficiency .
"I 'm currently working on a theme toggle for my website that uses Javascript / jQuery to manipulate the Body.bg color using a lightmode ( ) / darkmode ( ) function that is toggled by a button . What I want to do is create seamless transitioning between the body bg color with fade in and fade outs . I already have that made and created , but the problem is when the theme reads the storage type it will blink quickly in Chrome and Chrome Canary but in Safari , and Safari Tech Preview for Catalina it works seamlessly . However , I keep running into an issue when the user switches to white and then clicks on the nav link which then causes a black blink of the dark mode theme . My site starts with dark mode enabled and body bg is = # 0a0a0a , but when it switches to white and the storage is updated , it still inherits the black body - bg that is initially set in the style.less of my theme . If I remove the background color , then the white flicker happens on the dark mode theme , and ideally my end goal is to create seamless page navigation without the page blinking for a quick second reading the initial bg color before the body loads so - white on white bg , black on black bg no blinking to cause visual disruption.I 've tried every work around I could come up with and ca n't figure out a solution .

When I audit the site in Canary , and run it at slow 3G simulated there is no blink , but when it ran normally or at Fast 3G in the audit the blink occurs .

I have a text input within the summary tag of a details element which is in the open state . The intention is to capture user input which will eventually be displayed as a details element ( see below ) . However the details element toggles when the user presses the space bar while entering text . I want to prevent this . I expected that this could be done using stopPropagation in the keypress event but it does not seem to be working . How do I prevent the element from toggling ? I need to do this within a React component but I 'm posting a js/html example here for simplicity.One alternative is to use preventDefault onkeypress when space is entered and manually concatenate the space char but this seems inelegant

"I 'm working on a complicated map-reduce process for a mongodb database . I 've split some of the more complex code off into modules , which I then make available to my map/reduce/finalize functions by including it in my scopeObj like so : ... This all works fine . I had until recently thought it was n't possible to include module code into a map-reduce scopeObj , but it turns out that was just because the modules I was trying to include all had dependencies on other modules . Completely standalone modules appear to work just fine.Which brings me ( finally ) to my question . How can I -- or , for that matter , should I -- incorporate more complex modules , including things I 've pulled from npm , into my map-reduce code ? One thought I had was using Browserify or something similar to pull all my dependencies into a single file , then include it somehow ... but I 'm not sure what the right way to do that would be .

How did it work out , if at all ? Am I going down a bad path here ? UPDATE : A clarification of what the issue is I 'm trying to overcome : In the above code , require ( '../lib/userCalculations ' ) is executed by Node -- it reads in the file ../lib/userCalculations.js and assigns the contents of that file 's module.exports object to scopeObj.userCalculations . But let 's say there 's a call to require ( ... ) somewhere within userCalculations.js . That call is n't actually executed yet . So , when I try to call userCalculations.overallScoreForUser ( ) within the Map function , MongoDB attempts to execute the require function . And require is n't defined on mongo.Browserify , for example , deals with this by compiling all the code from all the required modules into a single javascript file with no require calls , so it can be run in the browser . But that does n't exactly work here , because I need to be the resulting code to itself be a module that I can use like I use userCalculations in the code sample . Maybe there 's a weird way to run browserify that I 'm not aware of ? Or some other tool that just `` flattens '' a whole hierarchy of modules into a single module ? Hopefully that clarifies a bit ."

"This is more about Node.JS , which uses the V8 engine . This is the JavaScript engine that is also used for Google Chrome.I hear about V8 being really fast , not just for Node , but for browsers too . However , one thing I notice about JavaScript , is that types are not coded for variables.To accomplish this in Java , you would need an Object variable type for everything . This would be significantly less efficient in , for example , a for loop : My question is , how does V8 handle variable types ? Does it know that this i variable is always either an int or long ? ( I see this as unlikely beause , i++ has the ability to convert a long to a double . ) Or does V8 handle things in such a way that it does not matter ? I think some simple examples of what the JIT compiler would create would be useful . Both Java and JavaScript do have JIT compilers to convert code to C.I am not a C programmer , but I am curious to know how types are handled , and if Java is really more efficient in that area .

"I 've been doing a lot of work in Node JS recently , and it 's emphasis asynchronous modules has me relying on applying the bind function on closures to wrap asynchronous calls within loops ( to preserve the values of variables at function call ) .This got me thinking . When you bind variables to a function , you add passed values to that function 's local scope . So in Node ( or any JS code that refers to out of scope variables often ) , is it advantageous to bind out of scope variables ( such as modules ) to functions so that when used they are part of the local scope ? Example in plain JS : Example in NodeIn my above examples , will func1 or func2 be noticeably faster than the other ( not including outside factors such as how long it takes to get file stats ) ?

"Long QuestionTo start , I know ECMA Script is the standard , and JavaScript and JScript are implementations . I understand that all three have their own specifications maintained , and there are many , many engines , interpreters , and implementations , but my specific question is : Assuming the implementation of a perfect interpreter and engine for each of the three , what could you do in one that you could not do in another , or what would have different effects in one than the other two ? I understand it 's a broad question , but as both languages ( JScript & JavaScript ) are derived from the specification ( ECMAScript ) , the practical differences should be negligible.Again , I 'm not talking about cross-browser compatibility ( IE8 & IE9 used different engines that interepreted JScript differently , and standards have changed over time ) , but pure ECMA5 , JavaScript ( if there is an official standard , I guess the closest is W3C or maybe MDN , and JScript ( which is apparently maintained at MSDN ( go figure ) ) .Notes : This is not a duplicate of this question which is five years out of date , and deals with the definition of the terms , not the applications of the languages , or this question which again explains that JavaScript and JScript are dialects of ECMAScript , but does not go into any functional differences.This question is closest , but specifically what I 'm after are technical pitfalls a developer expecting X and getting Y should be wary of . A good example would be from this question where the following code : showed a difference in implementations of JScript , that did not in theory comply with ECMA Standards ."

"I am surprised by the fact that a CSS3 transition rule applied via jQuery after a jQuery-based CSS property change actually animates this property change .

The height is then modified with jQuery via removal of one class : This reduces the height from 200px to 15px.After that , a transition rule is applied to the container via addition of a class : What is happening is that the reduction of the height becomes animated ( on Firefox and Chrome , at least ) . In my world , this should not happen if the order of instructions has any meaning.I guess this behavior can be very well explained . Why is that happening ? How can I prevent it ?

"I refactored my JS code recently and stumbled upon this pattern : The advantage to this is that it creates non-global variables with the functions having access to everything defined in APP . So APP.foo can access x , y , z , and bar without typing APP.bar ( ) , APP.x , etc . Everything can also be accessed globally with APP.bar ( ) , APP.x , etc . You can also nest them : So WIDGETS would have access to variables in APP , but not visa versa ( APP.WIDGETS.hello can use foo ( ) , but APP.foo has to use WIDGETS.hello ( ) ) .I tried creating this pattern using ERB ( I 'm on Rails ) , but it turned out messy . So I 'm thinking of writing a small source-to-source compiler for this - something like CoffeeScript ( with the minimal difference/extended language philosophy of SASS ) that just compiles a few functions to alternative javascript.I just want a shorthand.For example , this would compile to my second code block above : Simple and small - just so you do n't need to keep track of the variables .

"I was reading over the draft for ES6 , and I noticed this note in the Object.prototype.toString section : Historically , this function was occasionally used to access the string value of the [ [ Class ] ] internal property that was used in previous editions of this specification as a nominal type tag for various built-in objects . This definition of toString preserves the ability to use it as a reliable test for those specific kinds of built-in objects but it does not provide a reliable type testing mechanism for other kinds of built-in or program defined objects.From reading this thread on es-discuss , it sounds like [ [ Class ] ] is being replaced with [ [ NativeBrand ] ] in the ES6 draft so that they can specify it as being non-extensible ( those were at least Allen Wirfs-Brock 's thoughts ) .Curious , I ran a quick test in FireFox and Chrome ( with experimental JavaScript enabled ) : '' WeakMap '' is not one of the [ [ NativeBrand ] ] s specified in the ES6 draft . However , this test returned `` [ object WeakMap ] '' on both browsers.So I 'm confused . I have a few questions.1 . Do Chrome and Firefox behave correctly ? From one way of reading the draft it sounds like they should return [ object Object ] ( and all of this is pretty new , so I would n't be surprised to see this change in future editions of these browsers ) . However , it 's hard for me to understand the intention of this section of the draft , especially since there are some places with `` ? ? ? `` .Does anyone who has been following es-discuss more fervently have any relevant information ? Or anyone who can understand the draft language better ? 2 . Is there an alternative to Object.prototype.toString ? From the note quoted above it makes it sound as if Object.prototype.toString is retained for legacy reasons , as if there 's something new now that should be used instead . Especially the part of the node that reads `` it does not provide a reliable type testing mechanism for other kinds of built-in ... objects '' . Does that mean that future built-ins ca n't be tested with this method ? Let 's use a concrete example.If I want to ensure an object I have received from an unknown source is a String object ( an actual constructed String object , not a primitive string ) , I could do : This lets me know if unknownObject is a String object no matter what frame it was constructed in.My question is , should this be the approach I take moving forward into ES6 ? Or is there an alternative ? Something like Object.getNativeBrandOf ? 3 . Since [ [ NativeBrand ] ] seems like it wo n't include future types of objects , how would one test for these objects ? Will this work ? ... assuming Symbol is the eventual name for Private Names.Should I use this ? ... or something else ? The reason I ask is I am currently writing code that I want to be able to transition as easily as possible to ES6 in a year or two when possible . If there is a replacement for Object.prototype.toString , then I can just shim it in and continue from there . Thanks ! Updatebenvie 's answer provided me with the correct term to search for and understand the answer to my questions.I found an email from Allen Wirfs-Brock on es-discuss concerning this issue.Here 's what I found , for anyone else asking the same questions:1 . Do Chrome and Firefox behave correctly ? Yes , why is explained below.2 . Is there an alternative to Object.prototype.toString ? As it is now , there will be a couple `` alternatives '' in the sense of possibilities , but not in the sense of replacements.a . Using the @ @ toStringTag symbol . However , my understanding is that Object.prototype.toString should still probably be used . @ @ toStringTag is provided to allow extending the results that can be returned from Object.prototype.toString . If you have a prototype you would like to add your own string tag to , you could use @ @ toStringTag to set the value to any string . Object.prototype.toString will return this value except in the case where this value is one of the ES5 built-ins , in which case the string tag will be prepended with '~'.b . Using private symbols on user-defined objects . I read one email promoting this as the best way to do the same type of check on a user-defined object . However , I do n't see how that really settles the issue , as I fail to understand how it could be a cross-frame solution and it does n't let you check against ES6 built-ins.So even though there are some alternatives , it 's good to stick with Object.prototype.toString now and going forward , with one caveat : It 'll work to make sure you have an ES5 built-in , such as String , but it wo n't be fool-proof to make sure you have an ES6 built-in because they can be spoofed with @ @ toStringTag . I 'm not sure why this is , and I may be missing something , or it could change as the spec evolves.3 . Since [ [ NativeBrand ] ] seems like it wo n't include future types of objects , how would one test for these objects ? As mentioned above , Object.prototype.toString can still be used on ES6 built-ins , but it 's not fool-proof as it can be spoofed by anyone with access to the @ @ toStringTag symbol . However , maybe there should n't be a fool-proof method , since Object.prototype.toString ( weakmap ) == ' [ object WeakMap ] ' does n't mean that weakmap instanceof WeakMap ( and it should n't ! ) . The weakmap could have come from another frame , or it could be a user-created weakmap-like object . The only thing you really know is it reports to be functionally equivalent to a WeakMap.It does seem to beg the question why you ca n't have a user-defined object which reports to be functionally equivalent to a String or Array ( sans the prefixed `` ~ '' ) ."

"I use the JavaScript parser generator JISON to create a parser for some scripts that my users create . Lately I 've noticed that the parsing process on Firefox is by a large factor slower than on any other Browser my page supports ( IE10 , latest Chrome & Opera ) . After digging a little into the source of the generated parser I 've narrowed the problem down to one line of code which executes some regex to tokenize the code to parse . Of course this line is executed pretty often . I 've created a little test case with some random string ( ~ 1300 characters long ) and a pretty generic regex . This test case measures the average time it takes to execute the regex 10000 times ( Working example on JSFiddle ) : Following are the test results on my machine : Firefox 24 : Average time is between 370 & 450 ms for 10000 regex executionsChrome 30 , Opera 17 , IE 10 : Average time is between 0.3 & 0.6 msThis difference gets even larger if the string to test gets bigger . A 6000 character long string increases the average time in Firefox to ~ 1.5 seconds ( ! ) while the other browsers still need ~ 0.5 milliseconds ( ! ) ( Working example on JSFiddle with 6000 characters ) .Why is there such a big performance difference between Firefox and all other browsers and can I improve it anyhow ?

Using the node-kafa library , I am facing an issue with subscribing to consumer.on ( 'message ' ) events .

( Note : This code snippet is untested so I might have errors here , but the syntax is not in question here anyway ) What I am seeing here is when I start my server , there are 100,000 or so backlogged messages that kafka will want to give me and it does so through the event emitter . So I start to get messages . To get and log all the messages takes about 15 seconds.This is what I would expect to see for an output assuming the mysql query is reasonably fast : I would expect this because my first mysql result should be ready very quickly and I would expect the result ( s ) to take their turn in the event loop to have the response processed . What I am actually getting is : I am getting every single message before a mysql response is able to be processed . So my question is , why ? Why am I not able to get a single database result until all the message events are complete ? Another note : I set a break point at .emit ( 'message ' ) in node-kafka and at mysql.query ( ) in my code and I am hitting them turn-based . So it appears that all 100,000 emits are not stacking up up front before getting into my event subscriber . So there went my first hypothesis on the problem.Ideas and knowledge would be very appreciated : )"

"I have this code block to post a HTTP request via jquery .post ( ) method.When it is successful it is easy to know which request we are dealing with , since the json returned by the server has the 'product_id ' that I need.But if it fails due to an error in which the server is not responsive , a connectivity problem for example , how can I tell which request has failed ?

"I keep getting an ETIMEDOUT or ECONNRESET error followed by a Callback was already called error when I run index.js.At first I thought it was because I was not including return prior to calling the onEachLimitItem callback . So I included it per the async multiple callbacks documentation . Still not solving it . I 've also tried removing the error event and removing the callback to onEachLimit in the error event , but neither has worked . I 've looked at the other SO questions around the issue of Callback already called , but because they are n't concerned with streams , I did n't find a solution.My understanding is that if the stream encounters an error like ECONNRESET , it will return the callback in the error event and move on to the next stream , but this does n't seem to be the case . It almost seems if the error resolves itself i.e . it re-connects and tries sending the errored steam up to Azure again and it works , then it triggers the 'finish ' event , and we get the Callback already called.Am I handling the callbacks within the stream events correctly ?"
"Recently the application I work on upgraded from jQuery 1.7.1 to 1.10.2 with Migrate 1.2.1 included.After upgrading we noticed that jQuery returned different results for the extension method data depending on if the selector had any results . The attr extension method always returns undefined regardless of the selector results . Using the following HTML document I ran tests with versions 1.7.1 , 1.8.3 , 1.9.1 , and 1.10.2 . In 1.7.1 and 1.8.3 all results are undefined.In 1.9.1 and 1.10.2 results for an empty selector with .data ( `` blah '' ) switched from undefined to null.I 've reviewed the 1.9.0 upgrade documents as well as the 1.10.0 release notes and have n't found any indication of these changes . Does anyone know why this is ? Was it intentional ? I have included a fiddle to show how the various versions of jQuery have handled this.http : //jsfiddle.net/T5L6Y/6/"

If we look at the latest jQuery source at http : //code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js we see the following : My understanding of the new keyword in Javascript is essentially JavaScript passes the function an empty object { } and the function sets stuff on it via this.blah.Also from my understanding new differs from .call/.apply etc.. in that the return object also has the prototype set to that of the function . So the return value should have a prototype that the same as jQuery.prototype.init.prototype ( or jQuery.fn.init.prototype ) . However from what I see its prototype is set to jQuery.prototype thus all the commands available to work on the set.Why is this ? What am I missing in my understanding ?

"A clientside javascript library I 've developed uses objects as hashes in some areas . It loops through objects parsed from Json data with a for ... in loop using the property name as a key . eg ... ( pseudo code ) Unfortunately MooTools ( and Prototype , etc ) add methods to the global namespaces , so my for ... in loops now iterate through MooTools ' additions ( eg . limit , round , times , each ) , causing errors when it applies logic to them as if it were the data expected.As it 's a library , I have to expect that it will be used with MooTools , Prototype , etc . Is there an easy way around this problem ? My current solution is just to pass the object to a method which strips out the MooTools specific entries and returns the clean object , but this means also checking what Prototype and all similar libraries out there add , and seems to be a backwards way of doing things.My other solution is to stop relying on the property name as a key , and perform validation in the loops to ensure I 'm looking at the data I want to . Before I do that rewriting though , I 'm wondering if anyone has a better/existing solution ? Thanks : )"
I have seen answers on StackOverflow where people suggest furnishing a callback function to an AngularJS service.This seems to me to be an Anti-Pattern .

"In the book `` JavaScript : The Good Parts '' , it explains method string.match ( regexp ) as below : The match method matches a string and a regular expression .

"Consider the following excerpt from ECMA-262 v5.1 ( which I recently saw in this question ) : A Lexical Environment is a specification type used to define the association of Identifiers to specific variables and functions based upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code . A Lexical Environment consists of an Environment Record and a possibly null reference to an outer Lexical Environment . Usually a Lexical Environment is associated with some specific syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as a FunctionDeclaration , a WithStatement , or a Catch clause of a TryStatement and a new Lexical Environment is created each time such code is evaluated.I thought that meant the body of catch clauses would hoist its own variables like functions do , but apparently that 's not the case : Does anybody know why ?

But as you can see from the logging , in componentDidUpdate the ref is still pointing to the box : componentDidUpdate : the active shape is boxLogging in lines after that reveals the ref callbacks are hitbox ref null [ React calls null on the old ref to prevent memory leaks ] circle ref [ object Object ] You can drop breakpoints in to verify and to inspect . I would expect these two things to happen before we enter componentDidUpdate , but as you can see , it 's happening in reverse . Why is this ? Is there an underlying issue in react-three-renderer ( if so , can you diagnose it ? ) , or am I misunderstanding React refs ? The MVCE is available in this github repository . Download it , run npm install , and open _dev/public/home.html.Thanks in advance ."

"The following ( simplified ) json type of data defines a Contact : There is the following group of data : Goal is to find the groups that belong together using javascript ( optionally in lodash , but main idea is to get the algorithm clear ) according to the following constraint : a contact belongs to a group when any of the following criteria are the same : name , phone or email . The results shows the id 's grouped as arrays in arrays . a contact in a group of 1 is ignored.In the example above , it means that contacts with ids 1,3,5 belong together since 1,3 share the same email and 3 and 5 share the same phonenumber . Likewise 2,6,7 : 2 and 6 have the same name and 6 and 7 have the same email . 5 does not have anything in common.The expected result therefore is : [ [ 1,3,5 ] , [ 2,6,7 ] ] Background : One solution that works is iterating over every item and check for the remainder of the list if name , email , or phone is the same . If so , group them and take them out of the list ( in the example we compare 1 with all the items in the list and only 3 is found ) . problem is that next items also need to be checked again to these groups , because in this case 5 is not yet detected as part of the group . This makes the algorithm complex , while I suspect there is a simple way of solving this in linear time . There might also be a name for this class of problems ? `"

I wonder why putting a comma at the end of a single element is legal in a JavaScript array : while putting it at the end of a single element in an object is illegal ( at least my IDE - WebStorm - is flagging about an error ) : Is this really illegal in JavaScript ?

"This is my first post on stackoverflow , so please do n't flame me too hard if I come across like a total nitwit or if I 'm unable ot make myself perfectly clear . : - ) Here 's my problem : I 'm trying to write a javascript function that `` ties '' two functions to another by checking the first one 's completion and then executing the second one.The easy solution to this obviously would be to write a meta function that calls both functions within it 's scope . However , if the first function is asynchronous ( specifically an AJAX call ) and the second function requires the first one 's result data , that simply wo n't work.My idea for a solution was to give the first function a `` flag '' , i.e . making it create a public property `` this.trigger '' ( initialized as `` 0 '' , set to `` 1 '' upon completion ) once it is called ; doing that should make it possible for another function to check the flag for its value ( [ 0,1 ] ) . If the condition is met ( `` trigger == 1 '' ) the second function should get called.The following is an abstract example code that I have used for testing : The HTML part for testing : I 'm pretty sure that this is some issue with javascript scope as I have checked whether the trigger gets set to `` 1 '' correctly and it does . Very likely the `` checkCall ( ) '' function does not receive the updated object but instead only checks its old instance which obviously never flags completion by setting `` this.trigger '' to `` 1 '' . If so I do n't know how to address that issue.Anyway , hope someone has an idea or experience with this particular kind of problem.Thanks for reading ! FK"
"Problem : I have a small group of roughly 90 users which is extremely important , so when one or two of these business customers desire the UI changed in their web app , they usually get development resources dedicated . However , it 's important for us to understand exactly how the application is being used by the group as a whole because this group tends to have strong personal views on how their UI should look and they all use the app differently . I 'm having the most trouble with identification of their usage of hardware vs soft keyboard . Optimally I 'm looking for an answer as simple as , `` use the new Window.TabletMode == true ! '' I do n't think that simple answer exists.Research : SO question Detect virtual keyboard vs. hardware keyboard is the only significantly similar question I see but it focuses half of its time on using a JavaScript keyboard to replace the soft keyboard , so the answers talk about how to make the keyboard specific to numbers , dates etc . Additionally , he 's looking for cross-browser solutions where I need only IE11+ support . Finally , I can depend on the hardware keyboard being docked and a specific brand ( Dell ) . Finally , I can depend upon Windows/IE11 , so there could be other avenues of approach compared to this 3-year-old question . My use of a hybrid tablet also makes the approaches of capability checks useless since I already knwo all the capabilities ( touch , etc ) are already available on the device.I could check the Registry for the UI setting , but I really need to stick to JavaScript or something similar.Android has undocumented but known events which indicate showing and hiding of the keyboard . However , none of the users will be using Android.IE should receive a WM_SETTINGCHANGE message when the change occurs , but I 'm unable to determine if this is made available to a JavaScript API . I 'm thinking it would be a message far more specific ( if any ) , so I ca n't find anything with this search term and JavaScript.Code : From W3Schools , The window.orientation property returns 0 for portrait and 90 or -90 for landscape view.Combined with window.innerHeight , I could use something like ... Then I would use window.innerHeight in combination with the value of portrait to determine if the width to height ratio looks like I have a keyboard open . This approach really might work in fullscreen considering my fairly narrow constraints , but what if the browser is n't fullscreen ? I 'm sure there are plenty of other reasons to not write a hacky ratio calculation for this . Additionally , my greatest desire would , of course , be to do this with any browser and any screen size.These things I can handle : I 'd need to set variables on the loading of the document and work out a way to determine when the typing becomes relevant . I might need to check for some browser capabilities . Perhaps I 'd increment counters for typing with and without a hardware keyboard . Once I hit a certain number ( let 's say 5 keystrokes ) , I 'd send a POST request to my data tracking endpoint to let it know that session 12345 used the soft keyboard ( or hard keyboard ) . Afterwards , I 'd unsubscribe from the event handler . However I work this part is of less concern because I do n't think I 'll get stuck on anything , but I did n't want anyone to spend time on beautification or development of a huge example.Environment : Hardware should all be Dell tablet/laptop hybrids ( specific model TBD ) with IE11+ . I hate to make something IE specific , but if it runs on IE11+ , it 's totally acceptable.I should be able to pull in any sort of JavaScript libraries suggested , but keep in mind that JQuery 2.2 and Knockout 2.1 are already present , so little `` weight '' is added for a solution with JQuery usage.I probably ca n't get approval to write an application that uses ActiveX or some other heavy handed customized approach that would require installation of a local application because my company has roughly 50,000 users , and a deployment like that for 90 users would be overly complex to maintain.The screen sizes should all be 11 inches , but I 'd be sad to resort to using specific size and resolution because an answer like that would be extremely limited in application for me or future readers.Impact for Readers : I 'm seeing a move away from Ipads in the medical kiosk / EMR space because Ipads limit a lot of the UI choices in favor of a cohesive experience . Physicians especially will often get attention of high ranking IT leaders if they desire a very specific UI change . Microsoft has tended to allow a lot of non-standard intervention and ( more recently ) more standard types of intervention in how the browser works . I think a lot of this movement is going to Windows tablets for this reason and also for the reason that many medical groups are heavy on .NET development capability ."

"JavaScripts source maps seem to typically be at no finer than token granularity.As an example , identity-map uses token granularity.I know I 've seen other examples , but ca n't remember where.Why do n't we use AST-node based granularity instead ? That is , if our source maps had locations for all and only starts of AST nodes , what would be the downside ? In my understanding , source maps are used for crash stack decoding and for debugging : there will never be an error location or useful breakpoint that is n't at the start of some AST node , right ? Update 1Some further clarification : The question pertains to cases where the AST is already known . So `` it 's more expensive to generate an AST than an array of tokens '' would n't answer the question.The practical impact of this question is that if we could decrease the granularity of source maps while preserving the behavior of debuggers and crash stack decoders , then source maps could be much smaller . The main advantage being performance of debuggers : dev tools can take a long time to process large source files , making debugging a pain.Here is an example of adding source map locations at the token level using the source-map library : And here is an example of adding locations at the AST node level : Update 2Q1 : Why expect there to be fewer starts of AST Nodes than starts of tokens ? A1 : Because if there were more starts of AST Nodes than starts of tokens then there would be an AST Node that starts at a non-token . Which would be quite an accomplishment for the author of the parser ! To make this concrete , suppose you have the following JavaScript statement : Here are the locations at the starts of tokens : Here 's roughly where most parsers will say the starts of AST Nodes are.That 's a 46 % reduction in the number of source-map locations ! Q2 : Why expect AST-Node-granularity source maps to be smaller ? A2 : See A1 aboveQ3 : What format would you use for referencing AST Nodes ? A3 : No format . See the sample code in Update 1 above . I am talking about adding source map locations for the starts of AST Nodes . The process is almost exactly the same as the process for adding source map locations for the starts of tokens , except you are adding fewer locations.Q4 : How can you assert that all tools dealing with the source map use the same AST representation ? A4 : Assume we control the entire pipeline and are using the same parser everywhere ."

"There are many Stack Overflow questions ( e.g . Whitelisting , preventing XSS with WMD control in C # and WMD Markdown and server-side ) about how to do server-side scrubbing of Markdown produced by the WMD editor to ensure the HTML generated does n't contain malicious script , like this : But I did n't find a good way to plug the hole on the client side too . Client validation is n't a replacement for scrubbing validation on the server of course , since anyone can pretend to be a client and POST you nasty Markdown . And if you 're scrubbing the HTML on the server , an attacker ca n't save the bad HTML so no one else will be able to see it later and have their cookies stolen or sessions hijacked by the bad script . So there 's a valid case to be made that it may not be worth enforcing no-script rules in the WMD preview pane too . But imagine an attacker found a way to get malicious Markdown onto the server ( e.g . a compromised feed from another site , or content added before an XSS bug was fixed ) . Your server-side whitelist applied when translating markdown to HTML would normally prevent that bad Markdown from being shown to users . But if the attacker could get someone to edit the page ( e.g . by posting another entry saying the malicious entry had a broken link and asking someone to fix it ) , then anyone who edits the page gets their cookies hijacked . This is admittedly a corner case , but it still may be worth defending against.Also , it 's probably a bad idea to allow the client preview window to allow different HTML than your server will allow . The Stack Overflow team has plugged this hole by making changes to WMD . How did they do it ?

"I 'd like to move two images together on a page.The layout of this is the following : So the images are next to each other , cells that start with ' 1 ' belong to the first image , those that start with ' 2 ' belong to the second image.When I drag any of the images the expected behaviour is that both images move , but image 1 only on the vertical axis . ( So it remains on the left , but might move up or down as much as image 2 . This image will be used as a sort of header , and needs to be visible on the left all the time , but needs to be vertically in sync with image 2 . ) , image 2 can move along both axes.In the example this means that the 1.1 part of the first image will always be in line with the 2.1 part of the second image.Is there any JS framework that might support this ?

"I have a question about the architecture and performance of Node js.I 've done a bunch of reading on the topic ( including on Stack Overflow ) , and I still have a couple of questions . I 'd like to do 2 things : Summarize what I 've learned from crawling many different sourcessemi-concisely to see if my conclusions are correct . Ask a couple questions about the threading and performance of Node that I have n't been able to pin down exact answers on from my research.Node has a Single-Threaded , Asynchronous Event-Handling ArchitectureSingle-Threaded - There is a single event thread that dispatches asynchronous work ( result typically I/O but can be computation ) and performs callback execution ( i.e . handling of async work results ) .The event thread runs in an infinite `` event loop '' doing the 2 jobs above ; a ) handling requests by dispatching async work , and b ) noticing that previous async work results are ready and executing a callback to process the results.The common analogy here is of the restaurant order taker : the event thread is a super-fast waiter that takes orders ( services requests ) from the dining room and delivers the orders to the kitchen to be prepared ( dispatches async work ) , but also notices when food is ready ( asynch results ) and delivers it back to the table ( callback execution ) .The waiter does n't cook any food ; his job is to be going back and forth from dining room to kitchen as quickly as possible . If he gets bogged down taking an order in the dining room , or if he is forced to go back into the kitchen to prepare one of the meals , the system becomes inefficient and sytem throughput suffers.AsynchronousThe asynchronous workflow resulting from a request ( e.g . a web request ) is logically a chain : e.g . The work labeled `` ASYNC '' above is `` kitchen work '' and the `` FIRST [ ] '' and `` THEN [ ] '' represent the involvement of the waiter initiating a callback . Chains like this are represented programmatically in 3 common ways : nested functions/callbackspromises chained with .then ( ) async methods that await ( ) on async results.All these coding approaches are pretty much equivalent , although asynch/await appears to be the cleanest and makes reasoning about asynchronous coding easier.This is my mental picture of what 's going on ... is it correct ? Comments very much appreciated ! QuestionsMy questions concern the use of OS-supported asynchronous operations , who actually does the asynchronous work , and the ways in which this architecture is more performant than the `` spawn a thread per request '' ( i.e . multiple cooks ) architecture : Node libraries have been design to be asynchronous by making use of the cross-platform asynch library libuv , correct ? Is the idea here that libuv presents node ( on all platforms ) with a consistent async I/O interface , but then uses platform-dependent async I/O operations under the hood ? In the case where the I/O request goes `` all the way down '' to an OS-supported async operation , who is `` doing the work '' of waiting for the I/O to return and triggering node ? Is it the kernel , using a kernel thread ? If not , who ? In any case , how many requests can this entity handle ? I 've read that libuv also makes use of a thread pool ( typically pthreads , one per core ? ) internally . Is this to 'wrap ' operations that do not `` go all the way down '' as async , so that a thread can be used to sit and wait for a synchronous operation , so libuv can present an async API ? With regard to performance , the usual illustration that 's given to explain the performance boost a node-like architecture can provide is : picture the ( presumably slower and fatter ) thread-per-request approach -- there 's latency , CPU , and memory overhead to spawning a bunch of threads that are just sitting around waiting on I/O to complete ( even if they 're not busy-waiting ) and then tearing them down , and node largely makes this go away because it uses a long-lived event thread to dispatch asynch I/O to the OS/kernel , right ? But at the end of the day , SOMETHING is sleeping on a mutex and getting woken up when the I/O is ready ... is the idea that if it 's the kernel that 's way more efficient than if it 's a userland thread ? And finally , what about the case where the request is handled by libuv 's thread pool ... this seems similar to the thread-per-request approach except for the efficiency of using the pool ( avoiding the bring-up and tear-down ) , but in this case what happens when there 's many requests and the pool has a backlog ? ... latency increases and now you 're doing worse than the thread-per-request , right ?"

"Imagine I have a function which accesses a constant ( never mutated ) variable ( lookup table or array , for example ) . The constant is not referenced anywhere outside the function scope.My intuition tells me that I should define this constant outside the function scope ( Option A below ) to avoid ( re- ) creating it on every function invocation , but is this really the way modern Javascript engines work ? I 'd like to think that modern engines can see that the constant is never modified , and thus only has to create and cache it once ( is there a term for this ? ) . Do browsers cache functions defined within closures in the same way ? Are there any non-negligible performance penalties to simply defining the constant inside the function , right next to where it 's accessed ( Option B ) ?

"I have a map with Geojson polygons where each polygon is identified by a unique ID . I have a separate Geojson of point markers where each point is associated with a polygon with the same polygon ID , as well as a unique identifier for each individual point . The initial map display is of only polygons . Each polygon click will display the points that are associated with the clicked polygon . When a new polygon is clicked , I want to plot the points associated with the new polygon while simultaneously removing the previously plotted points . So each time the user clicks a polygon , ONLY points within that polygon are ever displayed . Here is some minimally reproducible code : https : //jsfiddle.net/3v7hd2vx/1146/In this example , the entire layerGroup of points is removed every other click based on the conditional statement at the end of the code block .

"I am familiar with OOP concepts through the languages like C++ , Java . Right now I am trying to learn JavaScript as a hobby , mainly due to the interest in WebGL . But I am having troubles with prototype based inheritance.Let 's say I have a base class which accepts a parameter in constructor . And I need to extend this . The way I am doing this is shown below.Now this is what I understand : A single Base object is serving as the prototype of Derived . So all instances of Derived will inherit properties from this Base object , e.g . the print method . When I call new Derived ( 10 ) then a new object is created , function Derived is called in the context of this newly created object , i.e . this points to newly created object , and function Base is called from function Derived , and then _n is created and assigned the value 10 . So if I create 5 Derived objects , all of them will have their own _n property . So far this is okay.But I do n't like this line : Function Base expects an argument but I am passing nothing here . There is no point of passing a parameter here as this object will act as prototype of Derived . And I do n't need any value of _n for this prototype object . But what if the function Base depends on the argument ? Say , Base loads a resource and the path is passed as parameter . What to do then ? To summarize , my questions are : What to do with data members in prototype object ( _n in this example ) ? Derived.prototype = new Base ; is creating an instance of Base and this will remain in memory always ( assuming Derived is defined in global space ) . What to do if Base class is very costly and I do n't want an extra object ?"
"ContextI have some CSS to do transitions : I 'm trying to find the maximum value in this list , which is easy enough to do with a regular expression.My issue is that when I get the CSS value it comes back asNow my regex gets the delay values ( `` 0 '' ) as well . Considering I 'm trying to find the maximum , that 's fine as well , but I 'm a purist at heart , and I would like to limit the matches to just the transition times.My Broken SolutionThe regex I concocted isThe reasoning breakdown : When I runthe results for each m are : jsfiddle exampleI thought the idea of a non-capturing group was that it would match the characters , but ignore them when you tried to access the groups.I have a hunch that I 'm looking at matches rather than groups , but I have n't figured out how to get the groups instead.Help ? UPDATE 1Per the comment , I updated and tried using RegExp.exec ( ) ( which I had already tried before , though it did n't work right until I updated r ) . The result ism [ 1 ] does capture the first number , but it ignores the following ones.I also discovered that the issue I was having with t.match ( r ) was the /g flag . Removing it gives the same result as r.exec ( t ) .Aside from splitting t on ' , ' and running the regex on each term , is there a way to do this in a single regex ? UPDATE 2 @ Esteban Felix 's alternative answer is clearly the best option.TL ; DR : Use the above for this case , but here 's an explanation of why maybe you should n't in other cases.The only modification I would consider would be appending + to the end of [ ^\d\. , ] , in order to decrease the number of replacements and improving performance by an imperceivable amount in more common strings ( not the .css ( 'transition-duration ' ) case , as I 'll explain in a second ) .The reason it might improve performance is that in Javascript , strings are immutable , so creating a new string for every character being removed takes up time . In my case , that 's only the 's and s 's . With a string ofthe spaces and the s 's are never next to each other , so the result would actually be a worsening of performance since now the regex engine has to check the following character every time it finds a character to remove . However , in more common strings where you remove a lot of consecutive characters , adding the + could improve performance . The only reason it might not is if the implementation of String.replace ( ) is smart , and uses a character array behind the scenes , only allocating space for a new string at the end of the function . This aspect is browser-dependent , but I would guess it 's the common case for modern browsers.It 's also worth noting that it 's important to use a + and not a * , as the latter would match every position between characters , replacing the matched empty string with the specified empty string . I do n't know whether the javascript engine would create a ton of new , identical strings or not , but it certainly ca n't improve performance.If you really care about this commonly-negligible performance bump , do some ( read : a lot of ) benchmarking . The only possible way you will see any difference at all is ifyou are running the code on a Compaq Presario 286 MMX with 64MB of RAM ( i.e . my first computer from 1997 ) oryou run this regex replacement many thousands of times in an inner loop on strings where most of the characters to be removed are in long , unbroken runs inInternet Explorer 1.5So , the modification to the selected answer might in fact reduce performance depending on your browser and the type of strings you run it against , but , as I said before , I 'm a purist , and love generalization and optimization , and thus my explanation ."

"I 'm programming an apartment & house rental site . Since there are never more than 10'000 properties for rent , it 's no problem to load em all into memory . Now , when a users want to search for a specific one , he can define very much filters for price , room , escalator etc.Every property has a very different set of attributes . One property may have an attribute that another property does not have . So , creating a Class in C # that has all the attributes , while only a few of them are used is not a good idea to me . I decided to use a Dictionary instead.A few benchmarks later , I found out , that the Dictionary is about 40 times slower in accessing attributes as a Class . I also did a benchmark for node.js , which just used objects as dictionarys . This was absolutely interesting because the exact same program in node.js performed even better than the C # example with a native class.In fact I got the following results : C # Dictionary : ~820msC # Class : ~26msNode.js Object : ~24msEach benchmark searched 1'000'000 objects by the same criterias.I know that the Node.js version is that fast because of the V8 engine by Google . Do you know if there is a C # class that uses similar techniques as the V8 engine and gets almost the same performance ? C # Dictionary BenchmarkC # Class BenchmarkNode.js Benchmark"

"Note before readingThis is not a duplicate of what-are-differences-between-xmlhttprequest-and-httprequestAnd for info , I tried this lib without success , because it copies the structure of the XMLHttpRequest but does n't actually act like it.I wonder what is the true network difference between HttpRequest from Node and XMLHttpRequest from a browser.If I just watch the XMLHttpRequest inside chrome 's devtools , I ca n't see any X-Requested-with header in the request.Besides , there 's an online service that is behind CloudFlare 's WAF with custom rules . If I make the request with XMLHttpRequest , it just works , but I do it with https.request it fails being firewalled by CF.I need to do it with HttpRequest so I can configure a proxy.What is the network difference between the two , and how could I simulate a XMLHttpRequest from a HttpRequest ? And is that even possible ? I watched the source of chromium here but ca n't find anything interesting.Maybe it differs from the IO layers ? TCP handshake ? Advices required .

"EDIT : Everything works ; the pushes work . The only problem is that on each push the # load_info div is reset to empty . How can I preserve the original content inside the div , though the content would be the updated version of itself as the XML file is re-pushed.I have a PHP script for long polling an XML file and encoding it as a JSON array . It is called from frontend with the JSON as the parameter.Then I have a jQuery script for instancing the JSON object ( msg2 ) for appending each node into a div called # load_data . My question is why is the jQuery below not working ? My guess is either the $ ( window ) .find is n't working in the get_person ( id ) function and/or my functions are out of scope with the polling . To note , the PHP and JS were 100 % working before I started trying to incorporate the show_person ( ) and get_person ( ) functions . Working as in , when a certain button inside the # load_button div was clicked it would toggle a piece of information 's view with an id that matched the button 's value attribute with .show ( ) , which was initially hidden ; then if another button was clicked the old info would be hidden with .hide ( ) and the new data would be seen . This was my round-about solution for using long-polling to update DOM elements by just loading them all up in the beginning , however if a piece of information is shown while a new poll occurs ( var timestamp gets updated ) , then the elements inside of # load_info will temporarily get lost from the DOM , therefore resulting in an empty # load_info div until the next button is clicked . So am trying to add some additional functions to store DOM data inside the var $ person so that after a poll whatever was shown prior would reappear . What can be changed or added to get this jQuery script working as intended ? Thanks in advance !"

"Using CSS columns I can format contiguous data into columns without having to manually break it into sections . This is especially useful when displaying complex , dynamic content.However when the columns ' content is so long that their height is greater than the viewport , dividing into columns makes for a poor reading experience . When the reader reaches the bottom of one column they must manually scroll up to begin reading the next.In traditional print layouts , readability issues with very long columns are generally mitigated by breaking the columns into sections that 'restart ' the column . ( Physical pages themselves form a natural separation that the endlessly scrolling webpage does not have ) . The image below shows how horizontal section breaks makes columnar content that is longer than the height of the viewport more readable . ( Note that by 'restart the columns ' I mean that once you reach the end of a left-hand column section you then read the right-hand column of that section before scrolling down to read both columns of the next section . https : //www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/newspaper-template ... might illustrate it more clearly ) .There are very few guarantees for the column content . It may contain any number of paragraphs , images , nested block elements , nested inline elements and so on . Example markup is shown below.I would like to automatically break my columns into regular sections after the columns reach a maximum height , as in the image above.I have not found any property that controls the layout of CSS columns in this way . CSS regions look promising but have very poor browser support.Computing the height of content with JavaScript and then inserting wrappers for each column block is probably possible , but not ideal . The content is dynamic and may change at any time , meaning the function must be run on every change . In addition the content may be very complex with sub elements that need to traverse section breaks , so naively inserting wrappers for each section will likely break the layout.How can I automatically set section breaks for columnar content after a maximum height ? ( I am not married to the idea of CSS columns ; perhaps a creative use of flex or inline-block will give the result I need ) ."

"Last week I answered an RxJS question where I got into a discussion with another community member about : `` Should I create a subscription for every specific side effect or should I try to minimize subscriptions in general ? '' I want to know what methology to use in terms of a full reactive application approach or when to switch from one to another . This will help me and maybe others to avoid unecesarry discussions.Setup infoAll examples are in TypeScriptFor better focus on question no usage of lifecycles/constructors for subscriptions and to keep in framework unrelatedImagine : Subscriptions are added in constructor/lifecycle initImagine : Unsubscribe is done in lifecycle destroyWhat is a side effect ( Angular sample ) Update/Input in the UI ( e.g . value $ | async ) Output/Upstream of a component ( e.g . @ Output event = event $ ) Interacton between different services on different hierarchiesExemplary usecase : Two functions : foo : ( ) = > void ; bar : ( arg : any ) = > voidTwo source observables : http $ : Observable < any > ; click $ : Observable < void > foo is called after http $ has emitted and needs no valuebar is called after click $ emits , but needs the current value of http $ Case : Create a subscription for every specific side effectCase : Minimize subscriptions in general My own opinion in shortI can understand the fact that subscriptions make Rx landscapes more complex at first , because you have to think about how subscribers should affect the pipe or not for instance ( share your observable or not ) . But the more you separate your code ( the more you focus : what happens when ) the easier it is to maintain ( test , debug , update ) your code in the future . With that in mind I always create a single observable source and a single subscription for any side effect in my code . If two or more side effects I have are triggered by the exact same source observable , then I share my observable and subscribe for each side effect individually , because it can have different lifecycles ."

The reason is that I need to reduce amount of code used and get a tighter control of mouse or tap events.I have built this Plunker to show the demo I use as a starter project for my panorama view.https : //plnkr.co/edit/eX2dwgbrfNoX9RwWaPaH ? p=previewIn this demo , mouse coordinates are converted to latitude/longitude , which would adjust camera position . This is the most basic , minimal panorama example from three.js site.When I was playing around with damping from OrbitControls.js ( see this line ) I could not quite get the same smooth behavior - interaction caused panorama to jump around : I do not believe I can fully understand how to apply it to my example in the Plunker.Can anyone guide me in the right direction to apply damping to my example from Plunker ? Update : I managed to progress by adding new delta values for longitude and latitude : see latDelta and lonDelta in updated Plunker . I got the idea how it works in OrbitControls.js . You can now observe an ideal smooth scroll on initial page load because of lonDelta = 0.35 . However , I am not sure how this is to be manipulated during user mouse scroll . At least I am moving in the right direction ."

I was digging around the jQuery source code and I found that they use this little code snippet to detect if a JavaScript object is empty.Can someone explain to me why this works ? I just do n't understand why this would ever return true .
"The nature of JavaScript allows for its native objects to be completely re-written . I want to know if there is any real danger in doing so ! Here are some examples of native JavaScript objectsLets assume that I want to model these to follow a similar pattern that you might find in Java ( and some other OOP languages ) , so that Object defines a set of basic functions , and each other object inherits it ( this would have to be explicitly defined by the user , unlike Java , where everything naturally derives from object ) Example : In this scenario , Object and Boolean now have new implementations . In this respect , what is likely to happen ? Am I likely to break things further down the line ? Edit : I read somewhere that frameworks such as MooTools and Prototype have a similar approach to this , is this correct ?"
"I often see that when a function needs to be called with bound parameters in no particular context the undefined is more often than not is preferred over the null as a choice of context , as in : is preferred over : I 'm wondering if there is any particular reason for this ?"
"I am using the Angular version of the $ q library however this would also be relevant for the original q library.Usage example : Unfortunately some function names ( e.g . finally ) conflict with javascript keywords.From the Angular reference : '' Because finally is a reserved word in JavaScript and reserved keywords are not supported as property names by ES3 , you 'll need to invoke the method like promise [ 'finally ' ] ( callback ) to make your code IE8 and Android 2.x compatible . `` ECMA-262 , the official standard , available at http : //www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm , states : 7.6.1.1 Keywords The following tokens are ECMAScript keywords and may not be used as Identifiers in ECMAScript programs . This means that the first example has to be changed into the following code to get it working with IE8 : As this code is harder to maintain I am looking for a javascript preprocessor ( maybe a grunt task ) which turns the first example into the IE8 compatible version.Is there such a preprocessor ?"
I am trying to make a table with Vertical Text just on the header table.Here is my CSS code : Here is the demo http : //codepen.io/anon/pen/GnveJAs you can see it works partially.I would like to have the columns ( the cells of the column where there are the name ) which width fits exactly the contents ( about 50 px ) ; the same as the pic I attached to this question.Any idea what is the best way to make the css code or js code for this purpose ? Requirement : I am using less and jquery

"I 've got this object in Angular.And in my HTML I need to loop through it to dynamically create a series of columns in my app ( think something like Trello ) Each type is a reference to a custom directive.I 'm trying to figure out the best way to place my directives.Based on this data , is the code below an appropriate way to handle dynamically creating these ? I 'd love to be able to do something like ... < { { obj.type } } -feed / > but I 'm not sure if this is valid , or if there 's a better way to create this.Thoughts are much appreciated !"
"So , using the Calendar API to pull all events from a publicly available Google Calendar.This were working fine until this morning.As I 'm not updating or doing any data alteration , we 've implemented an API key to access read only data as follows : Yesterday , pulled fine , today returns : code : 401message : invalid credentialsAny thoughts on this ? It 's affecting several implementations of this calendar code ( different keys , domains , etc ) but with the same basic methodology.I have not implemented the gapi client javascript library , may begin looking into that now ."
