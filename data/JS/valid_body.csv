"You can horizontally scroll my demo page by pressing Space Bar , Page Up / Page Down and Left Arrow / Right Arrow keys .

"I 'm going through the MDN docs on arrays and when we want to test whether or not an object is an array we use isArray ( ) . However , it 's usage is very different to most of the other methods . When you use the regular syntax an error pops up : Whereas this does work : I do n't understand why isArray ( ) ( and a couple of other methods ) rely upon some global object rather than just being accessible via the object in question .

For a client side search tool I need to find the Levenshtein distance of a word with millions of other words . A user should be able to compare a short text of about twenty words with a book . The user could do this by finding locations of the most characterizing words of the text in the book . 'Finding locations'does not mean looking for an exact match but nearly match as with levenshtein . I started with already available implementations but I needed more speed . I ended up with this : As you see I used techniques like placing the objects out of the function in order to re use them . I also repeated myself a bit by linearizing the loop somewhat . Could it be faster ? I am curious of your advice.Update : After tips from Bergi and some more thinking I came to this solution : This is again much faster . I can not squeeze more out of it . I keep looking for other ideas and will try some more .

"I have nested click event handlers within a component : ( Complete , minimal example at the bottom of this post . ) This component is used as a `` list item '' within a containing component . When I click on the ( Delete ) it fires the onDeleteClick as expected , which makes a callback to the parent which results in the component being removed from the parent component . The click event then starts bubbling up , as expected . However , it bubbles `` up '' to the next component in the parent list . After all , the original target was already removed by the delete handler.If I add an e.stopPropagation ( ) to the top of the onDeleteClick handler it all works fine , but I 'm just trying to understand why the click event is being delivered to a completely different component , just to make sure there are n't any other smoking guns in there.My current theory is that the pending event queue is somehow indexed into the virtual DOM in such a way that if you mutate the virtual DOM during an event handler , bubbling events could get delivered to the incorrect component in the virtual DOM . I would have expected the bubbling event to simply not fire , rather than firing on a completely different component.Is this what 's going on ? Any other insight ?

I tried to clone the div , fit it to the content , get its value and then use this value to transition BUT this means I have an initial width in percentages but a target value in pixels .

"Some time ago , I started to refactor my code of the main project , decoupling the business logic from controllers to services , according to guidelines . Everything went well , until I faced the problem of circular dependency ( CD ) . I read some resources about this problem : Question 1 on Stack OverflowQuestion 2 on Stack OverflowMiško Hevery blogUnfortunately , for me it is not clear now , how can I solve the problem of CD for my project . Therefore , I prepared a small demo , which represents the core features of my project : Link to PlunkerLink to GitHubShort description of components : gridCtrl Does not contain any business logic , only triggers dataload and when the data is ready , show grid.gridMainService This is the main service , which contains object gridOptions . This object is a core object of grid , contains some api , initialized by framework , row data , columns headers and so on . From this service , I was planning to control all related grid stuff . Function loadGridOptions is triggerd by gridCtrl and waits until the row data and column definitions are loaded by corresponding services . Then , it initializes with this data gridOptions object.gridConfigService This is simple service , which used to load column definitions . No problem here.gridDataService This service used to load row data with function loadRowData . Another feature of this service : it simulates the live updates , coming from server ( $ interval function ) . Problem 1 here ! gridSettingsService This service is used to apply some settings to the grid ( for example , how the columns should be sorted ) . Problem 2 here ! Problem 1 : I have a circular dependency between gridMainService and gridDataService . First gridMainService use gridDataService to load row data with function : But then , gridDataService receives the updates from server and has to insert some rows into grid . So , it has to use gridMainService : So , here I faced first CD.Problem 2 : I have a circular dependency between gridMainService and gridSettingsService . First , gridMainService triggering , when the grid is initially loaded and then it sets up default settings by the following function : But , to make some changes , gridSettingsService need an access to the gridMainService and its object gridOptions in order to apply settings : Question : How can I solve these CD cases in proper way ? Because , Miško Hevery Blog was quite short and good , but I have not managed to apply his strategy to my case.And currently , I do n't like an approach of manual injection a lot , because I will have to use it a lot and the code looks a little bit fuzzy.Please note : I prepared only a demo of my big project .

"For this question , I 'm not expecting a solution to solve something but would like to understand things better ..

When the create function is called , the following steps are taken : If Type ( O ) is not Object or Null throw a TypeError exception . Let obj be the result of creating a new object as if by the expression new Object ( ) where Object is the standard built-in constructor with that name Set the [ [ Prototype ] ] internal property of obj to O . If the argument Properties is present and not undefined , add own properties to obj as if by calling the standard built-in function Object.defineProperties with arguments obj and Properties .

"I have an application that is written around the MEAN web stack . I have created an API that depending upon the URL a JSON data set is returned for given weights . This is interconnected with my Mongo database . There are two returned JSON types , one for all weights and another for weights that fall between two dates . Not only am I displaying all of these weights in the first instance on one page ( home/index ) , but I am also displaying by a filtered set ( by date ) on an independent page . This independent page utilizes both angular-chart.js and ngDaterangepicker . These are both Angular directives that are injected into my code.When a date range is selected a ng-change function runs ( change ( ) ) which grabs a new set of filtered data ( by date ) . This data is then added back into $ scope.data the property , which when changed , should theoretically cause the chart to re-plot . Unfortunately , my application is not watching for new changes to this property inside of a on-change function . If a timeout is set outside of this function the graph will re-plot . So I am wondering if there is a better way or a different way to solve this problem . According to the documentation from angular-chart if there is any change to the value of $ scope.data the chart will re-plot the new values , however anything inside of an on change event listener/function will cause any new values set to $ scope.data to not be bound and cause the graph not to replot the new values . Why is the ng-change directive so special ? Below is my HTML and JavaScript.=== HTML View ====== Angular Controller ==="

"Is it possible to configure ESLint in WebStorm so functions , variables , etc . are parsed also from files in the same folder ?

TLDR- legacy code and project requirements.I need to minify all code . Current closure compiler can transpile ES6 into ES5 , but I found some ES6 features very prone to produce broken code . So I am forced to use ES5.As I need ES5 . I would only be able to use require ( ) to use modules .

That file is the module or the script . To group the files I use a Gradle plugin https : //github.com/eriwen/gradle-js-plugin , I inject a `` closure header '' and a `` closure footer '' , and all the files in between in the order I want.Despite the inconvenience , at the end I get super-compact nodeJS code , with all methods obfuscated , etc .

Most notably that : Controllers should never do DOM manipulation or hold DOM selectors ; that 's where directives and using ng-model come in.However , the project I 've been assigned seems to completely ignore this . For example , an excerpt from the MenuController : Should I move this code ( and a lot of other code ) to directives ? Or should I follow the pattern the application has already established and continue doing DOM manipulation in the controllers ?"
"I have an application which allows users to pick some time slots . By default the timeslots are empty , and my .NET back-end has default generated values of type DateTimeOffset , which by default are set to `` 0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00 '' .Now , when I populate a date on the front-end with this value , it generates a date in the local time zone , but with wrong minutes and seconds . This happens only in Chrome . I 'm not seeing this under Edge or Firefox.As you can see , I played around with the date , to see before which date this happens , but the problem may not be the year 1925 , just certain time before the current date . Does anyone know why this is happening ? Screenshot as requested"

"People here are using visual studio for performance testing . Now there are some small issues with some javascript parts : they are not able to check the performance of the javascript part with visual studio web-performance testing.I never used visual studio performance test , so I really have no idea how to bench stuff there , but I saw there are a lot of solutions for web + js performance check . I thought we could use other tools and frameworks , but its not allowed . People here want to use visual studio for everything . So this is making stuff more tricky.If I would have to check the javascript performance , I would easily do something like this : At the end I can see in the variable bench my result . Now I just have to pass this variable `` somehow '' to the visual studio performance test ? Via C # ? Or how is this stuff working ? Could this be a good solution ? Any other ideas ?"

"I have a class like so : How would I turn the send method into a promise , which returns a value from the socket 's data event ? The server only sends data back when data is sent to it , other than a connection message which can easily be suppressed.I 've tried something like : Obviously this wo n't work because resolve/reject will overwrite each other when chaining and/or calling send multiple times in parallel.There 's also the problem of calling send twice in parallel and it resolving whichever response comes back first.I currently have an implementation using a queue and defers , but it feels messy since the queue is constantly being checked.I 'd like to be able to do the following : Just to add , I do n't have any control over the data that is received , meaning it ca n't be modified outside of the stream.Edit : So it seems this is pretty impossible , due to TCP not having a request-response flow .

"In chapter 7.7 ( Punctuators ) of the ECMAScript spec ( http : //www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf ) the grid of punctuators appears to have a gap in row 3 of the last column . This is in fact the space character punctuator , correct ? I understand that space characters may be inserted optionally between tokens in the JavaScript code ( in order to improve readability ) , however , I was wondering where they are actually required ... In order to find this out , I searched for space characters in the minified version of the jQuery library . These are my results : A space is required ... ( see Update below ) ... between a keyword and an identifier : ... between two keywords : These are the two cases that I identified . Are there any other cases ? Note : Space characters inside string literals are not regarded as punctuator tokens ( obviously ) .Update : As it turns out , a space character is not required in those cases . For example a keyword token and a identifier token have to be seperated by something , but that something does not have to be a space character . It could be any input element which is not a token ( WhiteSpace , LineTerminator or Comment ) . Also ... It seems that the space character is regarded as a WhiteSpace input element , and not a token at all , which would mean that it 's not a punctuator ."

"The question is simple : I have a string str , how do I check if str is one single emoji , and nothing else ? Additionally I would prefer not using another library.Match `` '' , `` ⛹‍♂️ '' , `` 3️⃣ '' but not `` a '' , `` '' , `` '' I 'm having trouble finding a solution but here are some things I 've tried so far : Attempted Solution 1 - Play around lengths and ... operatorI learned that emojis occupy more than one byte , some even occupy 4 bytes , or more ... and we can measure that via the string 's length property : Then I found out that the ... operator takes this into account and correctly separates emojis in the array - I could then see the resulting array 's length property and detect if they were different.But this does n't check for other multi-byte characters such as whose length is 2 . Plus some emojis were still getting separated in a weird.Attempted Solution 2 - Regex , regular expressionsOf course regex would be a thing to look into but I 've yet to find a viable solution.This answer 's regex \u00a9|\u00ae| [ \u2000-\u3300 ] |\ud83c [ \ud000-\udfff ] |\ud83d [ \ud000-\udfff ] |\ud83e [ \ud000-\udfff ] works perfectly fine to detect if a string has any emojis , but applied to my situation it produces a lot of problems . Here are my tests : Part A - Without start/end of string regex ( ^ and $ ) 2A.1 str.match ( regex ) is very inconsistent , it breaks down some emojis and some other unusable . I do n't see a way to find out if it even contains non-emoji characters or if it contains more than one emoji:2A.2 regex.test ( str ) returns true whenever an emoji is included in the string , which is n't the behaviour I 'm looking for : Part B - With start/end of string regex ( ^ and $ ) 2B.1 str.match ( regex ) returns null on certain emojis for some reason . I have no clue why but I 'm assuming it has some relation as to why str.match ( regex ) would break down these emojis in Part A:2B.2 regex.test ( str ) will return false on the same emojis where it would return null on str.match ( regex ) : Part C - Other regular expressionsI found this one but it gives similar inconsistencies , although not the same / ( ? : [ \u2700-\u27bf ] | ( ? : \ud83c [ \udde6-\uddff ] ) { 2 } | [ \ud800-\udbff ] [ \udc00-\udfff ] | [ \u0023-\u0039 ] \ufe0f ? \u20e3|\u3299|\u3297|\u303d|\u3030|\u24c2|\ud83c [ \udd70-\udd71 ] |\ud83c [ \udd7e-\udd7f ] |\ud83c\udd8e|\ud83c [ \udd91-\udd9a ] |\ud83c [ \udde6-\uddff ] | [ \ud83c [ \ude01\uddff ] |\ud83c [ \ude01-\ude02 ] |\ud83c\ude1a|\ud83c\ude2f| [ \ud83c [ \ude32\ude02 ] |\ud83c\ude1a|\ud83c\ude2f|\ud83c [ \ude32-\ude3a ] | [ \ud83c [ \ude50\ude3a ] |\ud83c [ \ude50-\ude51 ] |\u203c|\u2049| [ \u25aa-\u25ab ] |\u25b6|\u25c0| [ \u25fb-\u25fe ] |\u00a9|\u00ae|\u2122|\u2139|\ud83c\udc04| [ \u2600-\u26FF ] |\u2b05|\u2b06|\u2b07|\u2b1b|\u2b1c|\u2b50|\u2b55|\u231a|\u231b|\u2328|\u23cf| [ \u23e9-\u23f3 ] | [ \u23f8-\u23fa ] |\ud83c\udccf|\u2934|\u2935| [ \u2190-\u21ff ] ) /g : Also this breaks horribly ( second test changes based on first test ? ) Is there a way around all this emoji/unicode/regex mess ?

"Consider the working code below : randN is a function that takes a number and returns an RNG that , when called , will return a random int in the range [ 0 , N-1 ] .

For example , I could write : This would satisfy the `` point-free style '' requirement , but fails to behave the same way as randN : calling badAttempt ( 10 ) simply returns a single random number between 1 and 10 , rather than a function that generates a random number between 1 and 10 when called.I have not been able to find a combination of ramda functions that enables me to do the rewrite in a point-free style .

"I am thinking about simple problem . I have given an class for example Modelso as you can see we can create new Model objects like : let model = new Model ( ) .

The question is what pattern should i use to instantiate object with given id only once ? Let 's go further : what if we will get nested objects with circural references ?

"So I have this neat little javascript function that I 'm using to print text to the browser window in a cool command-prompty style . It takes a string and prints it one character at a time to the window at a set interval . Here it is : ( I have cut out all the unnecessary parts so that this will work as a standalone example . ) Go here http : //www.jsfiddle.net/Chevex/6n5VV/ to try out the sample code above.If you are in IE or FF the code will run exactly as expected , writing out every character in the string until it finishes . However , if you run this code in Chrome or Safari you get an interesting bug . Sometimes , when the line hits the side of its container and the words wrap and drop to the next line , it freezes . The typing stops being rendered to the browser , but it is still happening in the DOM because if the page gets modified or the browser resized then the remaining text appears all at once.A couple things I have noticed about this are that it only seems to happen when it drops down a line with a leading space . Also , if you resize the browser window while the script is still running or after the script has finished , it will suddenly burst back into action and you will see the rest of the text . Any resizing , maximizing , etc will start the letters showing up again ; only to freeze again later of course.It 's extremely frustrating since it never shows the rest of the string unless the page is modified by more javascript afterward or the browser is resized . It completely defeats the entire purpose of writing the script in the first place when this happens.Any ideas ? I 'm completely stumped and Google turns up nothing.EDIT : If you can not reproduce the error it is probably because your screen is a different resolution than my own and you are getting lucky . Try to resize either the browser window , the jsFiddle display container , or both and then run the script again . It should n't take much before you see it freeze . Try to aim so that one of the lines will word wrap on a space , this seems to be where it happens mostly.I have done this in chrome and safari on 3 different computers , one on a completely different network altogether . If you still ca n't see the error then run it in chrome and firefox side by side . If chrome seems to finish earlier than FF then that is the freezing glitch in action . If you resize the browser or modify the page in any way then suddenly all the remaining text will appear at once ."

"Hey i have the following statechange event set on the window : i 'm using history.js but that does n't matter in this case as it binds the statechange regulary , i am getting the value of file like should be and works fine . Now i have this code ( and other code ) inside an external js file , inside the file i 'm iterating through all a tags and apply the following click event : Now when i click the document is getting changed as expected but when trying to use back/forward buttons statechange event does not fire.I should mention that this js is included in the files im loading as well.So my initial thought was that as the document changes but the window does n't , the event remains . which is not true as it applies the statechange event multipile times . So i tried applying the event once using cookie but that still does the same thing.Now if instead of changing the document i simply apply it with jQuerys .html ( ) the statechange event gets fired as exepected so i guess it 's related to the document.Why could this happen ? I believe if i understood more about what happens to window events when changing documents i could solve this problem.Tries : I have now also tried binding to the popstate event via regular History API , still same results give or take . pushState does n't fire popstate but back button does but without state.I have come to the conclusion that i should n't be using history.js as i susspect the problem came from there so i `` solved '' my problems with popstate which still causing problems as document.open seems to be firing popstate . still looking for more information I 've tried using on , same resultInformation : the fact this example us using History is because of history.js , if i use regular history API still same problems.I have read in mdn that : { { gecko_minversion_note ( `` 1.9.2 '' , `` Starting with Gecko 1.9.2 , document.open ( ) uses the principal of the document whose URI it uses , instead of fetching the principal off the stack . As a result , you can no longer call document.write ( ) into an untrusted document from chrome , even using wrappedJSObject . '' ) } } Which im not sure but i think could be realted to this problem"

"I 'm trying to build a really simple slider . I want to use CSS3 transitions for the animations and js to apply an animate-in and animate-out class to individual frames in sequence.I 've written a working demo of the basic intended functionality on jsfiddle here : http : //jsfiddle.net/7myKg/3/It 's very simple . A frame is animated in by applying the animate-in class and animated out by applying the animate-out class . For example this would display the second frame : Before I can animate-in a frame I need to ensure it is reset and the frame MUST NOT transition to it 's reset state . To achieve this I 'm adding inline styles to the frame to set it 's transition-duration to 0s before removing it 's animate-out class . This currently works as intended in Chrome . The problem I am having is that Firefox seems to be applying the animate-in class before the DOM has reflected the changes to the element 's style , and this causes the element/frame to transition backwards . Easier seen by running the demo in Firefox than explaining . I added a setTimeout wrap with a delay to demo how I was expecting it to behave.What am I missing ? Why does n't Firefox update the DOM element instantly ? I 'm building this myself from the ground up as a learning experience and because I thought it was a curious problem I would be able to solve . It is not intended for production , at least certainly not at the moment . For this reason I do not want to use one of the many existing solutions or plugins.Note : This is my first ever question so any constructive tips if I 've done something wrong on how I can ask better questions in the future would be greatly appreciated.Thank you ."

"Background : I have a self-taught hobbyist level of understanding of C++ , which has translated into a similar understanding of javascript . As an attempt to understand javascript better , I decided to write a Greasemonkey script that would solve a problem with how Google handles multiple results from the same domain.I wrote my script , and it was surprisingly easy . Now I feel like this script could be useful to others , so I 'd like to release it . Before I do that though , I 'd like to be certain I 'm not releasing irresponsible code.I know poor garbage collection is often cited as a problem with extensions , and did some research about what I would need to do in javascript to prevent that . It seems like the answer is any memory that is wrapped in a function will be reclaimed when that function exits . This seems to explain why a few popular scripts I looked at were wrapped in an otherwise useless function.This leads me to these questions : What should I do with my basic javascript function to ensure that it does n't leak memory ? Is this , which I 've seen in many scripts , an answer : In the above code , what is the purpose of the first parentheses ? It seems redundant to me.While I was attempting to understand that line , I rewrote it as : The idea being that this was just calling the the previously unnamed function .

"I am looking for a way to `` wrap '' all the $ http requests so that I can show a gif image whenever the application is doing some processing . I also want to use the same solution for other kind of background processing and not just $ http.The reason why I am asking is that I always have to set my processingIndicator to true and then switch back in my success function which is not elegant at all.One potentially solution that I see is to use a function that takes a function as a parameter . This function will set the processingIndicator to true , call the function and then set processingIndicator back to ` false.And thenThis solution is not very convenient because every time I need to notify the user that something is happening , I need to use this function.I am looking for a way to automate this process.Any other ideas ?

"I 'm trying to get server side rendering to work in VueJS.I 've been following the official docs , and I 'm attempting to get this example to work using axios . The endpoint is correct and the data does show up in the mutation.https : //ssr.vuejs.org/guide/data.htmlI also found this page and tried most of these examples , which includes using getters , vuex mapState , mapGetter , etc : vue.js 2 how to watch store values from vuexHere is store/index.js : the console log is displaying the correct information , so that means the axios endpoint is working and updating the state object . Originally , I was attempting to call the mutation , but I 've since tried calling the getter . Unfortunately , the new data is not being updated in the getter , so of course , nothing new shows up in the component.This is HomePage.vue : As written , htmlData will show : Yes , I did attempt many other variations on how to return the store item in the getter , but nothing is working.Aside from the stuff in the above links , I 've also looked around for variations on config files , I attempted to add async to store/actions , getData ( ) , etc.I also attempted to make the axios call directly in the component , which has had no success.Since this is a project that was already more-or-less completed in VueJS that I 'm converting to SSR , I removed everything from package.json and reinstalled every package , in the hopes that maybe one of the old vue packages was causing a conflict.I also attempted the store code splitting from the official docs , and tried variations on how the routes are written . Nothing at all works.I think I should add what the print statements show when I run my current code : The computed property in the component runs before the mutation is set . This causes the getter to be called before the mutation is updated . Likewise , if I 'm attempting to call changes to res directly from the component , there is nothing in mutations when the store is being called and rendered.This is a repo of the code I 'm attempting to run : https : //github.com/dt1/vue-ssr-attempt ( I figured out the answer .

"I 'm looking for a better way to manage global component/plugin/widget initialization in a large project . It has many jQuery-powered components that I would like to initialize quickly & efficiently and after scouring the internet , I 've only really found short-sighted examples that are only realistic/performant in smaller sites.The ProblemI Want to find a smart & elegant way of getting rid of this : Now before you smack me for it , let me state that I know that in most cases ( but not all ) .widget-one is a bad selector as it will on older browsers get all elements in the dom and check for the class.The issue is , these widgets are not one-off 's , and I may not know about thier existance ahead of time ( generated in a web app view , maybe 2-3 times based on logic or a loop of products or something ) .So the following solutions are out : andThoughtsThis is not a new problem , It 's been around since day one . It still baffles me how this is so difficult to solve with jQuery even at this level of maturity . Either that or I 'm missing something blatantly obvious.Unfortunately google-fu turns out badly on this subject as everyone suggests one of two things : jQuery 's .live ( ) or .delegate ( ) catch-all event handlers . This is just scary on a fundamental level . .delegate ( ) would n't be so bad , but this requires that the plugin/widget/control/whatever be entirely event driven . This would work in a lot of cases for sure , but not in others . It also makes following & organizing the code very complex . I wo n't even go into .live ( ) , for large complex sites , the event bubbling is slow & when you get enough components together , the list of queries to match becomes large making each click/focus/whatever event incrementally slower on the whole for the entire page.Work arounds that involve plugins like liveQuery , which is a very cool plugin for sure but it primarily seems to have been designed to solve a different issue ( the issue of new items being brought in by ajax/dom creation ) , and still will get incrementally slower the more queries that stack up that need to be checked against.ConclusionThere has to be a better way , I know there has to be one . I 've exhausted my google fu on the subject , and still can not find ideas/concepts/examples/discussion that is newer than jQuery 1.3.2 or with a grand picture in mind . In a perfect world this would n't be a problem because everyone would use intelligent browsers with modern standards & a decent javascript engine , and .class queries would n't take eons and eons , but unfortunately this is not the case.I 'm looking for ideas on how to tackle this , after going through many SO questions similar to this , and many articles on various jquery techniques I feel that if the information is out there it 's buried underneath the many false positives & `` 101 best jquery plugin '' results that turn up in any search with jQuery . I know someone out there has ran into this predicament.Ideas , links , examples , anything is welcome , there just has to be a better way ."

"I am using Auth0 as my authentication provider for a SPA using React . I have followed the Auth0 react tutorial and this more detailed tutorial from their blog.I am currently just using just email/password authentication .

Even after isLoading resolves to true , hence I have to log in again.This behaviour strangely does not occur on Chrome or Firefox . It fails on Brave and Safari.I noticed in a forum post on Auth0 ( another person with a similar problem ) that the Auth0Provider should be doing a authorize call using prompte=none , and it is .

"I maintain a greasemonkey script that monitors the current track playing as well as the progress on Soundcloud . Previously , I could just do require ( `` lib/audiomanager '' ) to get access to an object that would allow me to view the state of the entire page such as playing track info .

"Is the notion/concept of `` immediate events '' something that exists in Javascript implementations ? BackgroundIn this this answer to the question `` Is javascript guaranteed to be single-threaded ? '' the auther mentions something he refers to as immediate events .

Let me clarify with an example : ( As a jsfiddle http : //jsfiddle.net/rj25m/5/ ) Outputs of the script above for different cases/scenario : Case 1 ( No resizing takes place ) Case 2 ( Windows is resized after alert ( `` alert '' ) ; ) Case 3 interesting case ( Windows is resized during the alert ( `` alert '' ) ; popup ) NOTICE : Please observe ( as mentioned also in the answer mentioned ) , that on some systems it is not easy to resize the window during there is a modal alert . In MS Windows for instance one needs to temparily reduced the screen revolution to provoke the resize of the window . In other system , most linux , event though there is a alert you can still resize the window . NOTICE 2 : The ( Case 3 ) output I was only able to reproduce in Firefox ( used the 26.0 version ) . IE and Chrome did not seem to `` support '' those `` immediate events '' and it seems that there the resize event was noticed but scheduled to run after the completion of the block which was blocked by the alert ( `` alert '' ) . Case 4 ( like Case3 , but with Chrome/IE ) I am confused about the behaviour observed in the Firefox build and the usage of the term `` immediate events '' . I have my doubts if something like this actually exists . This is why I ask here , I expect that somebody is familiar and can answer with reference to the specs of ECMAScript and or reference to the specs of implementations.Looking at the MDN reference to the actual idea of `` run to completion '' I am inclined to think that the behaviour descriped by immediate events is nothing desired , nothing named and actuallye a Firefox bug . There is some reputation that firefox has some troubles with the alert since they introduced the new ( tab modal alert ) .I am happy for insight and open to answer comments"

I started learning react-redux-immutable couple of days ago and I am still quite confused about structuring my application . I have php ( symfony/laravel MVC background ) so it is not easy to get my head around some javascript concepts.1 ) I have lines WrapperComponent:2 ) That is connected to WrapperContainer3 ) Then there is addLine action4 ) That talks to LinesReducer5 ) So that WrapperContainer can listen to changes in state and re-render the linesNow my question is : Where do I put logic concerning the addLine action ? When I create a line I want to set its id AND I want to set its width same as width/height of another component.I guess that actions should only transfer information from one place to another . Then I am thinking ... maybe the logic should live at LinesReducer . But Lines reducer has no access to global state of the application so I do n't know what width/height the new line should have.Then there is WrapperContainer . Container has information about state of all application so it seems reasonable to loop through each line and set IDs if not set and update their width/height and other information.But that does n't seem right to me . I was thinking about one place that would gather information about global state of the application then it would add new line based on that information and nothing else would ever touch that line again . Except for another action.Is this the right approach ? I actually want to change the line width/height when another component 's height/width changes so container makes the most sense to me.EDIT : Maybe:1 ) set ID in action when the line is actually created ( I just do n't know how many lines there are already so I do n't really know what ID should I set ) 2 ) set width/height in container when it is passing lines to props ( but if I eventually want to render the lines in another container I would have to duplicate the code there unless I create some `` global '' function that handles passing lines to component props in containers )

"Here 's my situation . I 've created several panels stacked side by side which are wrapped in a main container . Each panel takes 100 % the viewport width and height . My goal is to be able to scroll horizontally to each panel when I click on their respective link . This works fine using a pure css approach . However , I 'm learning jQuery and I wish to use the .scrollTo ( ) method to achieve this.When the panels were stacked one below the other ( i.e vertically ) , I was able to obtain the top offset of each panel and scroll to their position nicely.With the horizontal variation , I 'm having troubles to obtain the left offset of the panels . I get a left offset of zero for all of them . If my logic is right , say the viewport is 1920px wide , the 2nd panel 's left offset should be at 1920px , the 3rd at 3840px etc.From the information I 've gathered so far , it 's because the panels are outside the viewport .

"I have been developing a chrome extension using Polymer for some time now and I have a couple of concerns about releasing it in it 's current state . I would like to hear about some strategies for preventing the following problems I have been facing : 1 ) Loading Polymer into the page leaks into the global namespace . Polymer does not come bundled into JS files but rather , it comes in the form of an html page and requires the user to use an HTML import to load it into the page . AFAIK , content scripts only allow for CSS and JS but not HTML . To resolve this issue , I am including it by dynamically generating a link element and adding it as such into the page : Once loaded into the host page , it does not run in isolation like content scripts and can cause namespace conflicts if the page already has Polymer loaded.2 ) Polymer does not tell you when it is loaded and ready to use . Polymer does not ( currently ) fire an event when it has loaded and as result , my components sometimes load before Polymer does and break.To mitigate this , I am triggering a custom event at the end of polymer-micro.html ( which is where Polymer ) is defined as such:3 ) The Polybuild tool does not generate proper code for a chrome extension . As useful as it is , it generates a separate javascript file outside of the dom-module causing a namespace leak into the global window object . For example , if was importing jQuery in my module , Polybuild would generate a JS file containing jQuery outside of the DOM module causing it to be attached to the host window object - a big no-no in a chrome extension.Thanks for the feedback.At the time of writing this , I am using Polymer 1.2.3"

"I 've written a fairly simple script that will take elements ( in this case , < p > elements are the main concern ) and type their contents out like a typewriter , one by one . The problem is that as it types , when it reaches the edge of the container mid-word , it reflows the text and jumps to the next line ( like word wrap in any text editor ) . This is , of course , expected behavior ; however , I would like to pre-format the text so that this does not happen . I figure that inserting < br > before the word that will wrap would be the best solution , but I 'm not quite sure what the best way to go about doing that is that supports all font sizes and container widths , while also keeping any HTML tags intact.I figure something involving a hidden < span > element , adding text to it gradually and checking its width against the container width might be on the right track , but I 'm not quite sure how to actually put this together . Any help or suggestions on better methods would be appreciated.Edit : I 've managed to write something that sort of works using jQuery , although it 's very sloppy , and more importantly , sometimes it seems to skip words , and I ca n't figure out why . # content is the name of the container , and # ruler is the name of the hidden < span > . I 'm sure there 's a much better way to do this ."

"Just to be clear , a class that inherits DynamicObject ( in C # of course ) is not the same concept as JavaScript 's variables being dynamic . DynamicObject allows the implementer to programmatically determine what members an object has , including methods.Edit : I understand that JavaScript objects can have any members added to them at run time . That 's not at all what I 'm talking about . Here 's a C # example showing what DynamicObject does : When a member of obj is accessed , it uses the TryGetMember to programmatically determine whether the member exists and what its value is . In short , the existence of a member is determined when it 's requested , not by adding it before hand . I hope this clarifies the question a little . In case you 're wondering , I 'm trying to determine if it 's possible to make an object in JavaScript , that when the function call syntax is used on it like so : The uploadSomeData call goes to a `` TryGetMember '' like function , which performs an $ .ajax call using the name `` uploadSomeData '' to generate the URL , and the return value is the result ."

"One problem with the standard mouseout event is that it fires not only when the cursor leaves the region of the screen bounded by the element 's external perimeter , but also when the cursor hovers over some other element contained within this perimeter.The rationale for jQuery 's mouseleave event is to signal only the moment when the cursor leaves the the area bounded by an element 's external perimeter.Unfortunately , this seems to work only if the `` obstructing '' element is a descendant of the `` obstructed '' element . If the `` obstructing '' element is where it is through absolute positioning , then when the mouse hovers over it , the mouseleave event on the `` obstructed '' element gets fired.For example , with the following HTML : ... # d-div is a bona-fide descendant of # b-div , whereas # c-div is n't , but , but we can style it so that it `` obstructs '' # b-div all the same . This is illustrated in this jsFiddle.If now one defines the following events on # b-div : ... then hovering the mouse within # b-div 's outer perimeter causes a blue outline to appear over this perimeter , unless the mouse is over # c-div.Is there a way to get the same effect with # b-div and # c-div as mouseleave achieves with # b-div and # d-div ? EDIT : I 've fixed the example shown in the jsFiddle . The original version of this example showed the unrepresentative special case in which all of the obstructing element overlaps with the obstructed element . In this special case , the desired effect can be simulated by defining the same events on both the obstructing and the obstructed elements , thus , in effect , turning the obstructing element into a patch of the obstructed element . This wo n't work when the obstructing element is not fully contained within the obstructed element 's outer perimeter ( as shown in the amended jsFiddle ) . More generally , any solution that is based on using a mouseover event on the obstructing element is bound to fail , since the real problem is to prevent ( or render ineffective ) the spurious mouseleave on the obstructed element ."

Not only can you create your own naming convention for events , but you may also pass custom data along the way !

"I happen to read about XSS and how to avoid it . From what I have read , I came to know that we need input filtering , proper handling of application code and output encoding to make the web application somewhat XSS safe . After going through several articles , several doubts still persist . When I tried jQuery.text ( `` untrusted_data '' ) or element.text=untrusted_data , thebrowser seems to be encoding the content perfectly , but I have read somewhere else that client-side encoding should not be trusted and you have to `` always '' encode at the server-side . Why is client-side encoding considered not safe ? Whenever I tried to set value using jQuery.val ( untrusted_data ) or element.value=untrusted_data it seems to be safe enough . So is it really XSS safe or did I miss any case here ? Also , I happen to read somewhere that jQuery.setAttribute ( attrName , untrusted_data ) and setAttribute ( attrName , untrusted_data ) are generally considered safe only if the Attribute Names does n't include URL Context based attributes ( src , href etc ) or Event Handlers ( onClick , onMouseOver etc ) . If that is the case , how am I supposed to set an href attribute by using setAttribute ( `` href '' , untrusted_data ) ? Is encodeForHtmlAttribute ( untrusted_data ) from server-side the right way of approach ? How should I handle dynamic html creation . Consider the below example < div id= '' divName1 '' onClick= '' copyData ( ) '' > untrusted_data < /div > < div id= '' divName2 '' > < /div > What I want to achieve here is to get the text from divName1 and paste it to divName2 's content . The code I wrote above is XSS vulnerable . I can change this to jQuery ( `` # divName2 '' ) .text ( divValue ) So , this will ensure encoding , but as I understood , we say that client-side encoding is unsafe and only server-side encoding should be used . How should I write this to be XSS safe without using client-side encoding ? I am a bit confused here : ( . Please help me out to clear these doubts ."

"The distinction between tasks and microtasks is important because IndexedDB transactions commit across tasks , but not microtasks . This is problematic when wrapping IndexedDB code in Promises , because in Firefox ( and maybe other browsers ) , promise resolution does not happen in a microtask , so your transaction will commit.The solution to this problem is to use a third-party promise implementation that uses microtasks . lie is one of those libraries , and under the hood it abstracts the microtask problem into another library called immediate , which uses MutationObserver to generate microtasks.That works great , most of the time . But in a Web Worker , MutationObserver does n't exist , so that trick wo n't work . Here 's an example of the problem in an easily-runnable GitHub repo . Basically I have this code : When I run that normally , it works fine . When I run it in a Web Worker , it fails because the transaction commits when immediate is called , before the callback runs . This happens in both Chrome and Firefox.As of now , I 've thought of two solutions : Do n't use promises , go back to callback hellUse promises with synchronous resolutionBoth of those options are highly unsatsifying . So I ask you , Stack Overflow , do you know of a way to queue microtasks inside of a Web Worker ?"

"I 'm having a problem using the jquery hover events . I 've created a reduction of the problem . You can find a working demonstration here . I can reproduce this after moving the mouse around in IE , FF , Opera , and Chrome.I 'm using queued animations in my mouseover event . Roughly 1 % of the time , the color of the td elements is left as # 0f0 after the mouse has left the td though . This should not be . The mouseout event should guarantee that eventually all tds turn back to # 00f after a time has passed.Update 2 : I 've now reduced this probably about as far as it will go . No mouse events used at all . It 's started working better in Opera , but now IE is a total cluster.Anyway , I 'm using a button to trigger this : See it here.Update [ n + 1 ] : I just ca n't leave this alone . I 've determined that the animation actually is occurring . It 's just not automating the background color . I 've done this by adding text and animating the background and foreground in unison . Under normal conditions , you should never see the text once it starts animating , but sometimes the background gets `` forgotten '' , and sometimes the foreground . This indicates to me , that a jquery animation is actually occurring , but it is just not animating all the attributes it was instructed to . For the curious , see it in action here .

Instead I could store callback asMy issue is that I would like to combine these two approaches according the rule 'get explicit return value otherwise get the result of the last executed statement ' .

This does n't work for my last example , see http : //jsfiddle.net/ZGb6z/2/ - out4 should be `` no '' but ends up being undefined as the last executed statement is not returned.Another suggestion is to modify the user input to add an explicit return on the last line if one is not found .

"How can I run a piece of code as soon as a form has been reset ? The reset event fires before the form fields get reset to their default values . So , for example : This wo n't work . ( Demo ) As the reset event fires before the browser handles the default form reset behavior , the code above simply sets the input 's value right before the reset event 's default action takes place , restoring the input 's value to its default value . This makes sense , as so I 'd be able to call e.preventDefault ( ) to cancel the form resetting.My use case requires executing code as soon as the form has been reset . In simple cases , a setTimeout would suffice : This works , as the setTimeout will execute sometime in the future , after the reset has finished bubbling and the browser has handled its default action.However , this loses synchronicity . As soon as I have to programmatically reset the form and manipulate it from another place , everything goes down the drain . ( Demo ) Of course , everything is supposed to happen synchronously , but only my reset event handling is pushed to asynchronously run in the future , thus it ends up running after all the current synchronous pile of code has executed , when it was supposed to run right after the form has been reset.Solutions I 've thought about : Use yet another setTimeout to run after the setTimeout . This is overly ugly and I refuse to jump into a setTimeout hell.Implement a wrapper for resetting the form which either takes a callback function or returns a promise object . This seems a bit overkill though.If only an afterreset event existed.. Well , did I overlook something or are the solutions above my only options ?

"I 've been looking for an efficient way to process large lists of vectors in javascript . I created a suite of performance tests that perform in-place scalar-vector multiplication using different data structures : AoS implementation : SoA implementation : The AoS implementation is at least 5 times faster . This caught me by surprise . The AoS implementation uses one more index lookup per iteration than the SoA implementation , and the engine has to work without a guaranteed data type . Why does this occur ? Is this due to browser optimization ? Cache misses ? On a side note , SoA is still slightly more efficient when performing addition over a list of vectors : AoS : SoA : Is there a way I can tell when an operation is going to be more/less efficient for a given data structure ? EDIT : I failed to emphasize the SoA implementation made use of typed arrays , which is why this performance behavior struck me as odd . Despite having the guarantee of data type provided by typed arrays , the plain-old array of associative arrays is faster . I have yet to see a duplicate of this question.EDIT2 : I 've discovered the behavior no longer occurs when the declaration for vector is moved to preparation code . AoS is ostensibly faster when vector is declared right next to the for loop . This makes little sense to me , particularly since the engine should just anchor it to the top of the scope , anyways . I 'm not going to question this further since I suspect an issue with the testing framework.EDIT3 : I got a response from the developers of the testing platform , and they 've confirmed the performance difference is due to outer scope lookup . SoA is still the most efficient , as expected ."

"An old idiom for getting very old browsers to ignore JavaScript blocks in HTML pages is to wrap the contents of the < script > element in HTML comments : The rationale is that old JavaScriptless browsers will render as text the contents of the < script > element , so putting the JavaScript in an HTML comment makes the browser have nothing to render.A modern browser , on the other hand , will see the < script > element and parse its contents as JavaScript . Consequently , the comments need to be valid JavaScript . The closing HTML comment ( -- > ) is ignored by the JavaScript parser because it is preceded by a JavaScript line-comment ( // ) .My question is , how does the opening HTML comment ( < ! -- ) not cause the JavaScript parser to fail ?

"IntroductionI 'm building an HTML5 web application that creates a visual representation of a binary search tree from a given list of numbers.Currently , I have an algorithm which calculates the visual spacing between nodes on each row based on the maximum depth of the tree ( which is a base-0 value ) : From here , the position of the node is determined using this offset and the x-position of its parent.The algorithm works well , because it 's always able to accommodate for the widest-possible tree of any depth .

"I want to pass a simple function to a web worker , rather than writing it directly in the web worker . I know this is n't directly possible , but that you can `` work around '' this in many cases by calling toString ( ) on your function and calling eval on that string , once it 's in the worker.The caveat that I have n't seen addressed elsewhere is that this function uses a class imported from another module .

"I wanted to try manually walking the prototype chain of a few objects just to see what I find along the way . However , I got stuck on the first one that I tried . Here 's the code : The above code results in the following output in the Developer Tools Console of Google Chrome : It makes sense that x 's constructor is the MyObject function , since x was instantiated using the new keyword on MyObject ( this follows from the definition of a constructor ) . Because of this , I understand the first line of output ( note : I started counting lines of output from zero on up ) . The second line , however , confuses me . I would like to know what MyObject 's prototype is . Apparently , it is n't an object of type Function , as indicated by the 3rd line of output , which tells me that I 'm wrong . The fourth line of output just reinforces the output from the first line.On a more general note , I assumed that the correct way to walk the prototype chain of an object would be to go from the object in question to its constructor , and then from the constructor to the constructor 's prototype , assuming that this last reference is not null . I assumed that this two-step process ( consisting of going to the constructor , and then to the constructor 's prototype ) should be repeated until a null reference from a constructor to a prototype is reached , thus signifying the end of the prototype chain . This does n't seem to be working , though , since application of this algorithm to the above scenario just leads to circular references.In summary , I have two questions : Why is x.constructor === x.constructor.prototype.constructor ( or , in other words , why the circular references ) , and what kind of an object is x.constructor.prototype , anyway ( or , in other words , how did it get instantiated / where did it come from ) ? How can the above algorithm be corrected in order to correctly walk the prototype chain for object x ? EditI came across a similar question on StackOverflow here , but it does n't explicity ask the correct way to walk the prototype chain . It does point out the circular references , though ..."

I 've managed that by including a generalwith PHP on every page , from a Config file that can be easily edited for every installation , so I can do with whatever JavaScript something like : What do you think of this approach ? Second problem : but I have PHP functions that return to me also the components folder , or the folder of other components . It would be nice to make the whole URL dynamic . This would account also for changes in the structure of the component if I want.The only solution I 've found is to use a .js.php dynamic Javascript . This is very unelegant , and I have to include all the framework in the JavaScript file , like : Another side effect is that I have to know exactly the include the path for framework.php ... I do n't want this so hard-codedin my `` .js.php '' file.Any smart solutions about that ?"
"This may seem like a particularly obscure point , however I am attempting to improve my grounding in the Javascript language as a whole ( more specifically its best and most efficient practices ) .Whilst testing a theory in http : //jsperf.com/ I came up with some odd results : Suppose we have two `` identical '' prototypes , defined as follows : Object1Object2Object1 has a consistent ( if marginal : ~3 % ) speed advantage over Object2 when performing the following simple operations : & You can run the tests yourself here . I am using Chrome 25 on OSX 10.6.8.What I would like to know is this : What is the reason ( s ) for this performance difference ? Is this performance indicative of some best practice in javascript ? Thanks in advance guys.EDIT : Thanks for the responses - as some have mentioned , further testing on my part seems to suggest that this issue is browser ( or rather , Javascript compiler specific ) . I 've tested additionally in Safari , IE 10 and Firefox . IE 10 and Firefox both gave results so close as to be no different . Safari executed the operations on Object2 slightly faster than those on Object1 ( around 2 % on average ) .

"I have an iframe that is generated in JavaScript with createElement ( ) when a function is fired , which becomes a text editor .

If I set contentEditable to true on the iframe 's body tag in the inspector it seems to work properly , but when I try to set this in my JS function , nothing happens in Firefox .

"I have a html < input > element that I want to accept only numbers and to be recognised on mobile devices as a number field .

I tried to resolve this by allowing only 1 ' . ' at a time but this failed as the input.value gets massaged by the browser e.g . ' 5 . ' becomes ' 5 ' , ' 5.. ' becomes null ( ! ) and it seems impossible to get the raw string value typed in the input . The above means checking for existing ' . 's and taking action appears to be a dead end ...

"Before suggesting bin packing algorithms , they assume you can re-order the elements and arrange them any way you please . Note as you read that I have a restriction on the ordering and arrangement.So obviously there 's no such thing as kerning divs , but it 's the most appropriate term I could think of . Basically I have a lot of elements on a page , divs and imgs , with fixed width and height . They have to remain in order ( they are chronological ) and should be displayed left to right , top to bottom . I want to `` kern '' the elements in such a way as to make the whitespace as uniform as possible . It 's a very easy task to achieve horizontally , but vertical whitespace is more difficult . Uneven excess whitespace around the outermost edge of the packed elements is acceptable.I was thinking as a really dumb solution , I could set the max width of the area to be packed to something like 1000px . Then I could keep an array with 1000 indices keeping track of the bottom of that column of pixels on the screen . When I add a new element , I see if it should be moved up a little into a gap and if shifting it left or right a little bit would allow it to be moved up.As I said , that 's a really dumb solution . Are there any algorithms I could use or has anyone had to deal with a similar packing problem ? UPDATE : Per questions in comments . The elements have random widths and heights . My test case is to create 100 image tags with images from placekitten.com with random widths and heights in the 200-300px range and arrange those images on the page in the order they are generated.Create an html page and throw the below code in your head to get to where I am ( please no comments on general code quality , I know there are some optimizations , I literally threw this together as a demo in under 10 minutes ) :"

"I 'm currently rendering Vue apps inside object tags ( iframe could work too ) of a container/master Vue app . First I setup a fileserver serving that container or the requested sub-app to render inside the div.For the sake of simplicity I will only show the required routing of my Node/Express serverMy app container / master Vue app is inside the view file rendered on /apps/ : appName , requests that sub-app and wraps it into object tagsThis approach works fine but the rendered sub-app uses the startup url http : //localhost:3000/subApps/app-one although it should use the url http : //localhost:3000/apps/app-one . When the sub-app loads the router instance I have to change the startup url from the iframe url to the browser url ( parent ) .

With this approach it 's possible to update the browser url while navigating inside the sub-app .

"Not sure if this is a new question so pls ref to any good source if you have any.My team is working on a big JS chart project we inherited from the previous developers who made intensive use of built-in objects prototypes for adding reusable code . We have a lot of new utility functions added to Date , Object and other intrinsic objects so I guess they went this way 'cause altering prototypes provides a bit more intuitive API.On the other hand our component suffers from performance/memory gotchas and we apply all the possible optimizations and best practices . I ca n't find one regarding API design . I 'm trying to figure out whether it 's better to seed built-in objects ' prototypes with library code instead of combining them in dedicated objects via somewhat namespace pattern.The question is which design is better ? And will one of them gain performance and/or memory over another ? vsThanks , guys , any help is appreciated ! EDIt : The main problem is that our component ended up being an awkward JS beast that slows down some mobile devices , especially old ones , such as iPad1 and early Androids ... We 've done a lot of optimization but I still see several questionable parts . I want to make sure if the built-in prototype pollution is another candidate to look into.Particularly , the Date and Object guys are heavily loaded with typical library code . For example , in fact the my_custom_function is a big big function and it 's not the only additional member that sits on the Date prototype at code startup.The Object is loaded even more . Most of the client code does n't make use of those additional features , it 's used on purpose - so we 're about to decide whichever way we 're better stick with : Keep using prototype pollution designRefactoring reusable APIs into separate library static objectsto be honest I have n't run perf benchmarks yet , will do once I have time . If someone has outcome/ideas will be very helpful ."

"In JavaScript you can compose objects using some kind of extend function . For example I might have an observable class that exposes a set of public methods ( get , push , set , increment , get , etc ) In this case the observable also happens to be an EventEmitter so it also exposes a further set of public methods ( emit , on , removeListener , etc ) Both of these classes have internal underscore prefixed properties that store the state . The eventemitter uses _events to store event handlers and the observable uses _state and _id to store state and the id.Now when I create a model using object composition like soThis causes an issue because Observable already uses the _state internal property and there is now a name clash.I would consider it ugly to just `` have to know '' what objects rely on what internal properties for the mixin to safely work.How do you avoid mixing in two objects which use the same internal property name ? Ideally this would be solved with ES6 private names , but we ca n't do that yet and we ca n't emulate them without losing performance . Unless you can provide a ES6 name emulation that does not have a large performance penalty I 'm not interested in those solutions.An alternative would be to use closures or bind but then you would be recreating the functions for every instance with is a significant performance penalty . Another alternative would be to namespace internal properties as __eventEmitter_events and __observable_state .

"I am having a slight issue with using dragabilly in angular , the problem is odd because it was working until I made some changes to how the content using packery is loaded in , specifically adding a level of nested repeats .

It broke when I Added in the nested repeat - these objects have multiple faces which I hide with that side.acive you see there , however the drag handle is inside the nested repeat and I think this may be the problem , or perhaps the nested is taking a bit longer to load in and it does n't recognize the handle in time ? I 'm not too sure and that 's where I could use some direction.Here is the directive - http : //jsfiddle.net/yq4zwLzs/ .

Perhaps it has to do with the order the inner repeat and the angulary packery run ? Update 2It appears the drag handle logic is not working at all , you can drag by anything , not just .handleUpdate 3I am almost certain this has to do with the nested ng-repeat ( perhaps it interacting in conjunction with how the directive runs on the object ) , because no matter what I try , as long as I have the nested repeat , I have the same issue . If I pull it off it goes back to working as normal , however It will be hard to achieve my desired goal without it : ( .Also - if i turn into It works fine .

From there is is relatively easy to calculate the curve needed to join them to the previous point along the alternative axis : However when there are not two straight , opposed sides ( as in the third example above ) I am unsure of how to find the points because there is no longer the certainty of the points lying along a straight line.I 've spent a long time looking for a documented approach , but to no avail.Here is an example of the kind of starting shape using SVG to describe it ( it does n't have to processed in SVG , as long as I can output to SVG .

"Why do n't getElementsByName , getElementsByTagName , and getElementsByClassName return an HTMLCollection ( W3C , MDN ) instead of a NodeList ( W3C , MDN ) ? All three return a live NodeList of only elements : NodeLists are great , but HTMLCollections are more specific as they can only contain HTML elements . It seems like this would be perfect for those methods . When a collection is created , a filter and a root are associated with the collection . For example , when the HTMLCollection object for the document.images attribute is created , it is associated with a filter that selects only img elements , and rooted at the root of the document . The collection then represents a live view of the subtree rooted at the collection 's root , containing only nodes that match the given filter . The view is linear . In the absence of specific requirements to the contrary , the nodes within the collection must be sorted in tree order . — W3C on collectionsA couple places HTMLCollection is already being used : NB : querySelectorAll returns a non-live NodeList ."

"This tutorial by Dan Abramov suggests that the advantage to using selectors that act on global state ( rather than a slice of state ) is that they allow containers to be decoupled from knowledge of the state structure.If that 's the case , should n't we also avoid directly mapping state values to props , and use selectors instead ? Otherwise , our containers must still know about where those values exist in the state tree.To illustrate using an example ... Directly maps a nested state value to a prop : VSHas no knowledge of state structure . Gets value using isModalVisible ( ) selector : However , the problem with the latter approach is that for each value in the state tree , we have to write a selector .

"SetupTwo WSGI servers running locally on different ports .

This loads the page , and does the cross-origin request.Ideally , the latencies should all be very low because it 's all local . However , I 'm consistently seeing latencies for the cross-origin request of well over ten seconds . What 's bizzarre is I 've only ever seen this in Chrome in a non-incognito window . Firefox , curl , httpie , and Chrome incognito tabs on the same machine all complete the cross-origin request in sub-10ms , while non-incognito Chrome tabs take three orders of magnitude longer.If I cut CORS out of the equation , and just put http : //localhost:9011 in the Chrome address bar , the json loads into view immediately . This apparently only happens when the request comes from javascript.If try to make another request to cors_server.py while a request to it in Chrome is `` pending '' , the second request will wait until the first one completes ) . This means the first request is somehow tying up the wsgi server for a long time before execution reaches the handler in cors_server.py.There 's definitely more going on when the request takes forever to complete . I collected the following using tcpdump -i lo0 dst port 9011 or src port 9011.This is a request from httpie ( http get localhost:9011 ) that completes quickly.This is a request from Firefox that completes quickly.This is a request from a Chrome incognito tab that completes quickly.This is a request from a regular Chrome tab that took ~18 seconds.It looks like Chrome tries IPv6 first , which wsgiref does n't like . So the connection resets the server sends make sense.In the case of non-incognito Chrome , it appears as though the client makes several connection attempts . The server resets the first couple attempts , then accepts a few , then using only one of those connections does the client actually send the request . I assume since wsgiref.simple_server is single threaded , the previous connections have to time out before the one that will make the actual request can get handled ; thus the delay.It 's interesting to note that even incognito Chrome still experiences a reset , but only it 's only retried once , and then works as expected . Firefox and httpie both only establish a single connection that works smoothly.QuestionsWhy does Chrome try to open so many connections for a single request ? What about Chrome 's incognito mode causes it to behave more agreeably , here ? Is this ... a bug ? ( In either Chrome or wsgiref ? )"
"I was messing around with transitions and I noticed some stuttering and flickering when the transitions are applied to the selection in a different function . If , however , the transition is applied with method chaining , it works exactly as prescribed . Below is small example ( Fiddle ) of simply moving some text .

The second , rightmost , string has a smooth transition from the top to the bottom of the page.Why does this 'teleport ' happen ?

Say , I want to apply the same transition to many different objects - retrieved from different selects - then is there a way to relegate the transition to its own function without getting this stuttering ?"

"In his Eloquent Javascript , Haverbeke claims that ( page 16 ) : '' In a JavaScript system , most of this data is neatly separated into things called values . Every value has a type , which determines the kind of role it can play . There are six basic types of values : numbers , strings , Booleans , objects , functions , and undefined values . `` But Crockford in Javascript : The Good Parts says : '' The simple types of JavaScript are numbers , strings , booleans ( true and false ) , null , and undefined . All other values are objects . Numbers , strings , and booleans are object-like in that they have methods , but they are immutable . Objects in JavaScript are mutable keyed collections . In JavaScript , arrays are objects , functions are objects , regular expressions are objects , and , of course , objects are objects . `` Now , at least under V8 I get this : I do n't understand if object is a type and function is an object or if function and object are both types . I guess I 'm missing the distinction between primitive types and other kind of types ( composite types ? ) ."

"I created a Wordpress theme and now I am working on an editor-stylesheet for the block editor to better reflect the look of the theme in the editor . For this , I need to be able to address different post types in there.For the frontend , there is the body_class ( ) function to be used in templates , which inserts - among others - a class which identifies the post-type and can be used in combined selectors to adress certain elements only in a particular post-type.Now , the post-type class is in the body tag of the page , also in edit mode , but apparently the editor-stylesheet CSS is applied in a kind of `` isolated '' way – combined selectors which contain classes that are in the body tag wo n't work in the editor.So I am looking for something similar which would work in the block editor , so that I can use it in combined selectors which only apply to certain elements in a particular post-type.Any ideas how to do that ?

Project I 'm working on uses jQuery.I have a series of Ajax calls being made that load ( ) other HTML fragments which in turn load ( ) other fragments . The whole thing is confusing . I did n't write the code . Is there any tool which will allow me to walk the callstack so I can figure what is calling a method ? any browser tools that would help me figure this out ? Resolution : In the end this was being caused because a < script src= '' ... '' was being injected in the server-side code . Your suggestions really helped - it was a combination of those and temporarily setting Ajax to sync instead async that helped me track down the issue .
"Our application has a list of tasks , which can grow quite large . The main tasks list has a sidebar , and when a task is selected , it can be edited in the sidebar - which uses a different controller ( TasksSidebarCtrl rather than TasksCtrl that displays the list ) . The selected task is copied , and then merged back into the list . this communication is handled in TasksService.The number of watchers per task in the index was huge , so we decided to take a different approach.Using one time binding has greatly reduced to number of watchers ( in fact , it 's only the submenu to edit/change the status of a task without selecting it in the sidebar that creates watchers now ) , but because we are using track by task.id ( which I see as a necessity considering the number of filters we have and how often the DOM will change ) , using splice does not remove and replace the task with the new updated task - which I understand is the whole point of track by.Is there a way to force to update of this task item whist still using both track by and one-time binding ? tasks-index.html ( I 've removed the filters to aid readability ) TasksCtrlTaskSidebarCtrlTasksServiceUsing a simple angular.copy ( with destination ) instead of TasksService.updateTaskInIndex ( vm.index , data.data ) in the TaskSidebarCtrl update function means that the one-time bound properties are not updated in the index view because of the one time binding . The above works without track by task.id but I do't want to make this sacrifice if possible . Nor do I want to sacrifice the one-time binding.Is there a workaround ?"

So that does n't mean the person that wrote this code even knew what he was talking about.1 Why declare the function using var myDOM = ( function ( ) { } ) ( ) ; instead of var myDOM = function ( ) { } ; 2 Why declare another function inside of the myDOM function with the exact same name ? Why not put all the inner myDOM 's logic inside the outer myDOM function ? 3 Why explicitly return `` this '' ? That would have been done automatically , correct ? 4 What 's going on here ? Is it returning the inner myDOM 's constructor ? If so , why ? UpdateSo most of it makes sense now . Regarding # 1 , I thought myDOM was being assigned the function defined after the = , but it 's not . It 's being assigned whatever that function returns . Which just happens to be a function.I 'm still not clear on # 3 . Yes , I understand using the function like thisWould display 'undefined ' . But that 's not how it 's being used .

"I am basically quite sure this pattern must exist and possess a name ... for now I will call it `` gate pattern '' ... Here it is : In my webpage 's javascript , I have to trigger various asynchronous processes .

And precisely once.ExampleThe Pattern : At the end of every ( sucessful ) Ajax-load-callback , the end of the GUI construction routine , etc ... I set a respective flag from false to true and call gatedAction ( ) Gate will check the flags , return if any flag is still unset , only calling the target function , if all flags ( or as I call them : gates ) are open . If all my async pre-conditions call gatedAction ( ) exactly once , I hope I can be sure , the actual targetFunction is called exactly once ( ) . In practice it works reliably . On a side-note : I think java-typical ( not js-typical ) synchronization/volatile concerns can be ignored , because javascript is not truly multithreading . Afaik a function is never stopped in the middle of it , just to grant another javascript function in the same document run-time ...

"I have been trying recently to make a slide of divs , using a script named Owl-Carousel , where divs are spaced by 10 px each so dragging looks nice.I made the whole code for showing purpose : http : //codepen.io/anon/pen/VLZmWdI tried modifying the margins without success.The CSS is as follow : How can I space slides between each other by 10px while keeping red/green areas same width and .generic class untouched.The reason I want the class `` .generic '' to be unchanged is mainly the way I 've sat up my code , so that the CSS is easily modifiable for widths : I have a lot of different classes/elements which are supposed to take the wrapper width , I wish not to have to set width for each of them or set margins , for code manageability.EDIT : To make it clear , when using mouse dragging on the carousel , my objective is to see 10px of white between each slide green slide ( which is n't the case in the codepen ) while keeping the green area width the same as the red area width.Thanks"

"Many times , I needed to write such a lazy asynchronous loading in Javascript : Here , myvar would be some attribute of a hash , not a local variable . loadMyVarAsynchronously loads asynchronously the value for myvar ( with , for example , a Promise or a JQuery Deferred ) Is there a pattern to avoid having to write twice the following line in this code ?"
Let 's say we have a function that looks like this : This function should return the value of x where x is available in the global scope . Initially this is undefined but if we define x : Then we can expect fn to return 42.Now let 's say we wanted to render fn as a string . In JavaScript we have toString for this purpose . However let 's also say we wanted to eventually execute fn in a new context ( i.e . using eval ) and so any global references it uses should be internalized either before or during our call to toString.How can we make x a local variable whose value reflects the global value of x at the time we convert fn to a string ? Assume we can not know x is named x . That said we can assume the variables are contained in the same module .

"Summary : poll ( ) functions with callbacks are available ; I have n't found any using native promises . I 've tried to adapt some without success . The problem I have n't solved yet is that when the first instance of the function called by setTimeout ends without any return , the .then ( ) listening for it sees the termination as a false and a reject ( ) . then ( ) terminates and does n't listen for later returns.Question : How best to help the .then ( ) function stick around for later returns with resolve ( ) or reject ( ) ? The rest of this post is detail . Read what helps.Available poll functions : I like ( https : //stackoverflow.com/users/1249219/om-shankar ) Om Shankar 's response in Calling a function every 60 seconds . David Walsh 's poll ( ) is very similar ( at https : //davidwalsh.name/essential-javascript-functions ) . Both use callbacks and work well . I foundpoll in javascriptwhich includes a poll ( ) using bluebird-only promises.Here 's my attempt at implementing with native promises.Expected usage : The way I think this is running ( please correct me if I 'm wrong ) : After the call to poll ( ) at *1 , we quickly return a pending promise at *2 so that poll ( ) knows to wait . Then , we call that promise 's then ( ) function at *3 . Function p ( ) starts . If fn ( ) ( known outside p ( ) as waitIsOver ( ) ) returns true at *4 , we 're good : We return resolve ( ) and poll ( ) at *1 gets the settled promise it seeks.Then the bad part : If fn ( ) returns false at *4 and we 're inside endTime at *5 ( which is likely ; the first call is unlikely to occur after endTime ) , we use setTimeout ( ) at *6 to ask JS to make a note in the stack to instantiate another p ( ) after interval time . After that , the first instance of p ( ) terminates at *7 . At *8 , then ( ) knows that p ( ) terminated without returning anything and interprets the condition as returning false and reject ( ) ; with reject ( ) , the promise is settled and can never change . However , after expiration of interval , a successor instance of p ( ) fires up . Anything it returns is lost ; the promise is settled and then ( ) has terminated after sending execution on an unwanted path.How do I convert an existing callback API to promises ? recommends an approach with a Promise constructor , resolve ( ) calling callback ( ) , and reject ( ) calling errback . I tried the technique , but I ran into the same problem of the then ( ) function ending before I want it to . I have n't yet figured out how to make then ( ) as patient in waiting as a callback function.That sets up the question . Again : Question : How best to help the .then ( ) function stick around for later returns from resolve ( ) or reject ( ) ?"
"I inherited a library recently , there is an update method which exists on a class . Here is an example . This kind of code mostly only exists on performance critical stuff . Most of the rest of the project is not written this way . Floor is used twice . Surely caching it in a local variable simply forces some `` temporary '' memory allocation every time it is run ? How is that faster than simply looking up a function ? This.currentX is referenced many times during the body of the function but is caching it really any faster ? I would have thought that this.currentX involves no lookup issues but maybe I am wrong . Since this is happening to the remaining code in the example , all of these properties are cached . Does any of this really matter at all any more on modern JavaScript engines ? I would assume that the optimizations such as this , if they are faster ... . Would be taken as a given for optimization anyway inside V8 . For example if Math.round was called 20 times in a function , then the engine would cache it anyway ? I would also expect stuff like caching a length before you `` for it '' is also another example of what I presume optimised engines to do anyway when interpreting the code ( again , only IF it even makes a difference ) . All I really want to know is ... from this day forward , should I be doing these Micro-Optimisations ( for evergreen browsers ) and optimizing my code or have things moved on a little now since 2010 ( when I read Performance JavaScript ) Thanks !"

"I 'm looking for a way to properly replace nested custom tags with their HTML equivalents .

Again , using spans can solve this in this case , but that wo n't work with things like `` ul '' , `` li '' , `` h1 '' , ...

"Considering object creation patterns with private properties , one way to do is : Problem with this : Every instance of Stack has it 's own copy of methods 'push ' and 'pop'.Another way for implementing constructor method is : Problem here : We lose the privacy of list and index.Is there a way , such that we can have both methods reuse among instances and privacy of properties ?

"I am experiencing odd behavior when data linking an object to a form that led me to re-question what exactly is being data bound ?

In the case when I have to create a company , everything works as I expect . However when I have to update a company , things do n't work like how I expect them to . Please have a look at the following code.Here is my sample Form HTML : Here is my Javascript code : Instead of the form input showing 'Company ABC ' , it is empty . However if I enter anything in it , then the Company.Name value does change ! But while I want the input to data bind to Name property of my Company object , I also want it to be aware of any changes made to the ( parent ) Company object and update it 's data binding to it 's Name property accordingly . So my question is how should I change the way I am writing this code so that I can achieve a data bound both on the root object as well as the property ?"

"I 'm displaying a weather map in a GWT application . I 'm using GWT 2.7 and the GWT wrapper of the GoogleMaps JavaScript API available here ( gwt-maps-3.8.0-pre1.zip ) .I use a tile server to fetch the weather , which updates every 5 minutes . On the 5 minute mark , I refresh the map by setting the zoom to 1 and then back to the original , by triggering a resize , and by removing and then adding the weather layer again.This worked fine . However , recently I noticed that this no longer works : the refresh never even goes to the tile server , so no new weather is displayed . If you leave my map up for 12 hours , you 'll be looking at weather that 's 12 hours old . Previously , the map would automatically stay updated . I have n't changed any of my code . So my guess is that something changed in the underlying GoogleMaps JavaScript API.However , I then created this simple pure-JavaScript example : To my surprise , this still works fine . Whenever you click the Refresh button , the map goes to the tile server and fetches new tiles.So I tried doing the exact same thing in GWT : This should do the same thing as the pure-JavaScript example . Instead , when I click the button , the map does refresh ( I see the weather layer blink ) , but it does n't actually go to the tile server for new tiles.Weirder still , this `` sorta '' works in Internet Explorer : maybe 1 out of 3 times I click the button , the map actually goes to the tile server . But in Chrome , it never goes to the tile server when I click the button.To determine this , I am looking at the network tab of the browser tools . I would expect the map to hit the tile server every time I click the button . That 's what it does in pure JavaScript , and that 's what it used to do in GWT , but sometime in the last couple months the GWT behavior has changed.I do n't think this is a browser caching issue . The problem is not that the map tries to fetch new tiles but gets old ones , it 's that it never tries to fetch new tiles . I click the button , and I see nothing happening in the network tab of the developer tools.Why do I see a different behavior in JavaScript vs GWT ? Why do I see a different behavior in different browsers ? Is the GWT GoogleMaps library doing some kind of internal caching ? Is there a way to disable this ? Why has this behavior apparently changed ? How can I make the GWT map refresh by going to the tile server for new tiles ?"

"Configurable properties seem to be deletable : But it does n't work in the following case , at least on Firefox and Chrome : But this seems to contradict the spec.The delete operator is defined like this : 11.4.1 - The delete Operator The production UnaryExpression : delete UnaryExpression is evaluated as follows : Let ref be the result of evaluating UnaryExpression . [ ... ] If IsPropertyReference ( ref ) is true , then Return the result of calling the [ [ Delete ] ] internal method on ToObject ( GetBase ( ref ) ) providing GetReferencedName ( ref ) and IsStrictReference ( ref ) as the arguments . So the result of using delete depends on [ [ Delete ] ] . Now let 's see what [ [ Delete ] ] does : 8.12.7 - [ [ Delete ] ] ( P , Throw ) When the [ [ Delete ] ] internal method of O is called with property name P and the Boolean flag Throw , the following steps are taken : Let desc be the result of calling the [ [ GetOwnProperty ] ] internal method of O with property name P. If desc is undefined , then return true . If desc . [ [ Configurable ] ] is true , then Remove the own property with name P from O . Return true . Else if Throw , then throw a TypeError exception . Return false . Therefore , if the property is configurable , it should be deletable.But wait , maybe Object.getOwnPropertyDescritor is a troll and says that a property is configurable , but [ [ Configurable ] ] is false . Let 's see : 15.2.3.3 - Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor ( O , P ) When the getOwnPropertyDescriptor function is called , the following steps are taken : If Type ( O ) is not Object throw a TypeError exception . Let name be ToString ( P ) . Let desc be the result of calling the [ [ GetOwnProperty ] ] internal method of O with argument name . Return the result of calling FromPropertyDescriptor ( desc ) . So it also uses [ [ GetOwnProperty ] ] , like [ [ Delete ] ] . Maybe the troll is FromPropertyDescriptor ? 8.10.4 FromPropertyDescriptor ( Desc ) When the abstract operation FromPropertyDescriptor is called with property descriptor Desc , the following steps are taken : If Desc is undefined , then return undefined . Let obj be the result of creating a new object as if by the expression new Object ( ) where Object is the standard built-in constructor with that name . ... Call the [ [ DefineOwnProperty ] ] internal method of obj with arguments `` configurable '' , Property Descriptor { [ [ Value ] ] : Desc . [ [ Configurable ] ] , [ [ Writable ] ] : true , [ [ Enumerable ] ] : true , [ [ Configurable ] ] : true } , and false . Return obj . So no , it is not a troll neither . The configurable property of the property descriptor is set to the [ [ Configurable ] ] value.How is it possible , then , that a configurable property ca n't be deleted ?"

I start researching the problem and come to the point that is problem with setTimeout ( ) inside a loop . This is an article what I found Watch Out When Using SetTimeout ( ) in For Loop # JSThis line is a Node-Schedule package It basically calls the script every 15th minutes ( if someone is wondering that it is ) My goal : How can I change my code to still having a 2 second 's delay and working loop . Is there any alternatives to use instead of setTimeout ( ) , maybe I just need to put a setTimeout ( ) in another place in a code or maybe there is even some type of packages that I can add additional.Problematic code area : FULL CODEEDIT1 : To be more correct I 'll specify the task more accurate.My node-schedule package suppose to call the script every 15 minutes and I want to call properties in array every 2 seconds . I need to call properties from array every 2 seconds otherwise I will receive IP ban from Binance API for calling the API to much/fast.EDIT2Alright . setInterval ( ) is not a solution for me . Since I need to call the script every 15 minutes it should go through array and when it call all properties from array it suppose to stop . In setInterval ( ) after calling the all properties in array in starts it again , this is does n't what I need , unfortunately.EDIT3 : I tested few options from answers below , all of them get me to the same problem that the script can not start the second time or the script is starts working immediately or repeats even after array properties are ended . Still thank you for answers , but my problem is still one.Currently I trying to use async/await methods . But I receive an error that await is only valid in async functionEDIT4 : So this is a fullcode solution from @ yoavmatchulsky . Script starts working , but I do n't receive any data or something .

"I want to write a function in JavaScript that will apply a style object to an html element but only if that object exists.Example , if I have the following object : So I use hasOwnProperty ( ) to first check that `` style '' exists before trying to apply it - and this works fine.However , let 's imagine that my object has multiple styles : Now , sometimes these individual style objects can be the same . The above examples are short but the objects can be much larger and hold multiple style properties , so it would be better if I could do something like : So I could then do something like this : The problem is that the first call to hasOwnProperty ( ) : Evaluates as true , which is great . However , subsequent calls fail even though the objects contain either a `` style '' or `` apply '' object.Here 's the full code I 'm working with : Here 's the two functions I 'm using : So it works like this : The elInit ( ) function calls elApply ( objElement , `` mouseout '' ) ; The `` mouseout '' property exists , and the elApply ( ) function evaluates objElement.hasOwnProperty ( `` mouseout '' ) as trueChecks to see if objElement.mouseout.apply exists , but apparently objElement.mouseout is undefined , despite the earlier hasOwnProperty ( ) call suggesting `` mouseout '' exists.Hope this is clear , any ideas ? It 's not a big deal , just be neater if the objects were n't repetitive and I could re-use already defined objects.Perhaps there 's a fundamental flaw in my logic/implementation or understanding of hasOwnProperty ( ) ?

"I understand that Javascript does n't have multiple threads , but I 'd like to know if the following code has any chance of breaking . My understanding is that unless an asynchronous function is called , such as setTimeout or an AJAX call , that once a block of code starts executing there 's no way for it to pause until it completes or does call an asynchronous function.Basically , users select multiple checkboxes and then hits a button that executes AJAX processing of their selections . My goal is to have a `` Saving ... '' icon that stays only until all the AJAX processes are complete , and after all are finished display a success message.Barring any AJAX errors , so long as the callback function in the jQuery.post executes in its entirety without interruption , I do n't see how the if ( numProcessed == toProcess ) would ever execute more than once or less than once . But if two AJAX callbacks get into the callback function , both increment the numProcessed counter before either get to the following if , then it seems that the code inside would be executed twice ."

However , after doing cfx xpi and installing the extension into my firefox browser , it does not work at all . The action button and context menu item do not appear , and although the extension shows up under add-ons - > extensions as installed and enabled , none of the images packaged with the xpi will display.I am not sure what could be causing this , and my code is fairly brief , so I will add my entire main.js : I 've noticed that when I run cfx xpi the automatically generated install.rdf file says the maximum version for compatibility is 30.0 . However , I have also found that on some computers running versions of firefox up to and including 38 it will work perfectly . Is there anything in this code which would prevent compatibility with newer versions of firefox ? I will add the ContentScriptFile in case that may be responsible :"

"I am currently working on a JavaScript ( pure js ) based game . The game contains 5 large sprite sheets ( e.g . 2861 × 768 and 4096 × 4864 ) . When the game starts , all 5 sprite sheets are preloaded to canvas elements . Three of those 5 sprites represent together one animation , where each sprite contains 75 frames . When one sprite ends with its animation , I hide it and display the next sprite . When the second sprite finishes animating , I hide it and display the third/last one . When the second or third sprite is about to be displayed , a small delay of 0.5 s - 1 s happens . The image is being decoded.It is not something that happens just the first time , it is something that happens always . And that animation repeats every 5 minutes , and the small delay happens always.The reason why I 'm using canvas elements for preloading is that I thought WebKit would just throw away decoded images for some time being unused and that the canvas element would prevent WebKit from deleting it from memory . But that does not work.I 've tried almost every optimization I 'm aware of . I have even refactored all my CSS by removing descendant selectors etc . The renderer I 'm using to draw those animations is built by myself and it is working perfect , so that could not be the problem , since it is working very well in Firefox.EDIT [ 2016/03/04 ] : I made a mode with canvas and the result is even worse . It laggs a lot . And the delay remains the same . Only in NW , the problem does not persist in Chrome neither in Firefox.Canvas mode - Lags : Default ( HTML ) mode - Works perfect : Codepen : My renderer http : //codepen.io/anon/pen/JXPWXXNote : If i hide those other elements with opacity:0.2 rather than opacity:0 , the problem does not happen . But , I can not hide them like that since they remain still visible . They should n't be visible . If I add opacity:0.01 it is not visible and the problem does not happen in Chrome , but still persists in NW.In NW , when I swtich from opacity:0.2 to opacity:1 , an image decode is being processed . The same thing does not happen in Chrome browser.I am using the following version : The three image sprites are 14.4MB , 14.9MB and 15.5MB size . Each sprite contains 75 frames.Why could this be happening and how can I prevent it ?"

"( http : //eloquentjavascript.net/07_elife.html ) Im having a hard time understand what the Grid methods we added .get and .set even do.Firstly , lets go through an example case . var grid = new Grid ( 5,5 ) ; now space is an array of 25 elements . And of course width and height are 5.Now the question is what is the method of `` get '' doing . Now we said console.log ( grid.get ( new Vector ( 1 , 1 ) ) ) ; .So x becomes 1 , y becomes 1 in the new object we created . Of course we need to do grid.get thus we return this.space [ 1+ 1 * 5 ] i.e the 6th spot in the space array which is 25 elements long . So why does this print undefined ? Is it because there is n't anything in the space array ? TLDRHow do the .get and .setprototypes work here ( what do they do ) ? Also why do we set return this.space [ vector.x + this.width*vector.y ] ; , is there some numerical significance to vector.x+this.width*vector.y ?"

I was looking over the js source code for Scrabb.ly.I 've noticed that they would do something like so for each of their distinct `` classes '' : Some code from the middle has been omitted but this should give you the general idea.What is the purpose of the the following : ( function ( ) { // code } ) ( ) ; Is this the module pattern that I 've seen talked about ? Is this meant to keep the global namespace clean ? What does this line mean ? : var self = { } Is the self object used to exposed 'public ' members ?

"I 'm a bit confused about loading and playing sound effects . My game is setup in different states , first the Preloader state makes sure all images and sounds are loaded . The GameState is the main game , this state is re-started for each next level . There are different levels but the state is the same , it just changes a _levelIndex variable and uses the same state.The GameState adds the needed audio to the game in the .create ( ) function , and this create-function is called every time the GameState is started . See code belowThe problem is that when I play the punch sound a couple of times in a row a couple of seconds apart , the console gives this warning ( which Phaser raises in code here ) Phaser.Sound : Audio source already existsThis warning appears even when the GameState is started for the first time.I suspect that it has to do with decoding the mp3 and ogg sounds . Do I have to decode the sound samples every time the player starts ( or restarts ) a level i.e . restart the GameState ? In other words , if the GameState will be .create ( ) each time a level is ( re ) started and the audio samples are added using game.add.audio , will the decoded samples from the previous level be destroyed and have to be reloaded/decoded each time ? That seems wasteful , what is the best way to do this ? So my questions are : What does this message `` Audio source already exists '' mean ? Orshould I ignore it ? if I want to use sounds in a state , do I have to re-add them every time the state is started and .create ( ) is called ? also somewhat related , if I want to use the same sound sample in multiple different States ( menu , game , options etc . ) do I have to do game.add.audio ( ) for the same sound for each state ?"

"There are a number of puzzles that are variant of the classic `` 7 Bridges of Konigsberg '' puzzle where you must find a route through a set of rooms without ever using a door twice.Here is an example of one without a solution ... . and is a slightly modified puzzle that does have a solution , as you can see here.I 'm interested in a programmatic approach to solving these sort of problems and while there are a number of ways to determine that a particular configuration of rooms and doors has no solution , I am interested in computing the lists of doors to visit to solve the puzzle . One way to view the problem is to transform it 's configuration into a graph and solve for the Hamiltonian . This sort of problem however requires tacking on inelegant logic because of the constraint that `` U-Turns '' are prohibited.I hacked up a solution in a few minutes to show the problem . It is a brute-force solution that puts the `` rooms '' into groups , with the added invariant that you can not move from one `` door '' to another `` door '' in the same room ( as that would entail doing a U-Turn ) .I feel that there must be a better abstraction for representing this problem that does not resort to the following `` tricks '' : Having additional logic for removing doors in the same room as valid choices when the path has just come from that room . Producing a graph that is n't isomorphic to the input room configuration.Filtering all configurations that do n't satisfy the U-turn constraint . ( Variant of # 1 ) Is there an existing body of literature tackling these sort of problems , and if so , what are their conclusions ? Are room problems fundamentally at odds with the methods employed by the most well-known graph algorithms such that it requires this special logic ? If there is a better solution that is n't a transformation to a graph , I 'd love to hear about that as well.Here 's the existing code that does work , the groups represent the first problem , the groups that are commented out represent the latter problem . : The doors are labeled as follows :"

So far I 've tried applying CSS to the input elements ( display : block , float : left , etc ) but that leaves the text in odd places like the next line or all bunched together while the buttons float left.Using jQuery , I 've been unable so far to get the text and input as a unit to wrap them in a label or < p > or whatever.Here 's how the current output looks in a browser : Any suggestions for a javascript and/or jQuery way to fix this ?

"I have built out an Angular directive to display a D3 visualization .

"Bear with me on this.tl ; dr My code only works when I put newlines between function arguments . Is there a maximum on stack size or function declarations per line in javascript ? I 've been testing a hypothesis of mine that if you 're creative enough , all javascript functions can be re-written ( by sacrificing speed and readability ) without using : Spaces or newlines ( By extension , this prevents the use of many keywords ) Declared datatypes ( e.g . `` `` , [ ] ,0 , false , { } , etc . ) More than one statement per scopeOperators of any sort ( including logical and relational ) Or , in layman 's terms , the whole function should match /^ [ a-zA-Z ( ) { } . , ] * $ /.The biggest challenge I 've faced so far in the process of proving this hypothesis ( I have n't gotten to regular expressions , that ought to be fun ) is dealing with mathematics , which is heavily dependent on operators and numbers.I 've written up functions which follow my parameters and : calculate basic arithmetic ( add ( a , b ) //a+b ) form integers ( digs ( one , three , six , eight ) //1368 ) get and set object properties ( setprop ( a , b , c ) //a [ b ] =c ) The general idea is to structure functions like below , to make algorithms marginally more readable and writable in this manner : My functions work individually , as well as in this form when there are few enough of them , but as I 've added more , I 've noticed an extremely peculiar bug : Given the large amount of anonymous functions my code requires , I presumed there was a maximum number of anonymous functions javascript can handle in one line , but I ca n't find any documentation that says this or otherwise.Here are three versions of my code : VERSION 1 : Without newlines , Does n't workLogs function anonymous ( urn ) function anonymous ( urn ) on Chrome . ( What is `` urn '' ? I do n't have any variables by that name , and the only instances of that string are in `` return '' keywords . ) Logs function anonymous ( ) function anonymous ( ) on Firefox.VERSION 2 : With one newline , worksLogs function anonymous ( x , y ) function anonymous ( x , y , z ) .VERSION 3 : Beautified for your viewing pleasureI do n't think I can call this a bug in javascript , given the nature of what I 'm trying to accomplish , but it would be good to have documentation on the maximum number of anonymous functions per line if one exists ( for minimizing large libraries , for instance ) .Has anyone seen anything like this before ? Any advice ? Thanks so much.P.S . Please avoid `` your hypothesis is dumb '' answers . That 'd be nice.EDIT : Just an update on the conversation so far : To clarify , I DO NOT want it to output function anonymous ( ) function anonymous ( ) .

"Okay , my first attempt at trying to explain what I was doing failed miserably . I 'm basically copying Crockford 's Object.create ( ) , except with private variables.If you look at the accepted answer here How to inherit from a class in javascript ? , you will see Object.create as the last pattern , which I think better fits the prototypal nature of Javascript ( objects beget objects ) instead of emulating classical inheritance ( classes beget objects ) .If you look at Wikipedia 's article on prototype based programming ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming ) , you can see more of what I mean.The drawback with Object.create ( ) though is that there is no support for private members . This is what I propose : Then , you create objects as thus : The way I made the `` from '' function is such that when a parent object changes its methods , if you want to prevent the change in a child instance , you can specify : in the child instance.Note also that objects created ex nihilo do not inherit from Object ( hasOwnProperty , etc.. ) . You must explicitly specify this as .from ( Object ) .Benefits of this pattern : Memory is not wasted for each new instanceIt adheres to a true prototypal inheritance patternYou have access to the parent object using this.parent ( this.__proto__ is browser specific ) Private variables now existThere is one major drawback of this method that I can think of : the 'function ( ) ' syntax may confuse people into thinking a function is assigned to the variable instead of an object.My question is , are there other drawbacks that I am missing ? ( Do n't include drawbacks of the prototypal pattern -- that 's subjective -- but only of my implementation ) ."

"There seems to be a mismatch between the common understanding of == and what it actually does . To give some background for the issue : Seemingly , both Number and String are of object type . No surprise there . However things get interesting for == which should return true when operands are equal regardless of their type.According to a somewhat authorative description : Operators attempt to convert the object to a primitive value , a String or Number value , using the valueOf and toString methods of the objects . If this attempt to convert the object fails , a runtime error is generated.In short , == should compare objects by their primitive value .

Unless I just do n't understand them.Edit for clarity : If you append a < style > < /style > tag to the < head > < /head > of html you can apply styles with style.sheet.insertRule ( styleString ) , and added styles will apply for the document.If you have already appended that < style > < /style > to the < head > < /head > like < head > < style > < /style > < /head > , and attempt to append < style > < /style > somewhere else like < div > < style > < /style > < /div > all the styles are lost , and do not apply again.Is this normal ? The code flow : Works : append < style > any whereadd styles with style.sheet.insertRule ( styleString ) Does n't work : append < style > any whereadd styles with style.sheet.insertRule ( styleString ) to < style > append same < style > somewhere elseMy other issue is that styles added to < style > < /style > do n't show up in Firebug even if they have applied to the document.Edit more clarity : If I reappend the style element without having modified the stylesheet , the styles remain : But if I have altered the stylesheet with JS , the changes are undone :"

"I am in the process of building a revolving text generator . The generator combines sentences ( text ) from a number of arrays , 'cycles ' through them visually and appends them . I thought it best to create a Fiddle with a basic version of the generator as I have constructed it now : ExplanationThe basic workings are as follows : Sentences are defined in separate arrays ( Array1 , Array2 and Array3 in the fiddle ) A second set of arrays is defined , containing the arrays that can be combined ( combo0 and combo1 in the fiddle ) On pressing the 'Generate ' button , the function Generate is called , which visually cycles the sentences from an array of sentences ( combo0 [ 0 ] in the fiddle ) This function loops itself until the sentence has cycled 8 times ( var times = 8 in the fiddle ) When this is done , the function calls the callback function that was provided . In this callback , it runs Generate again , this time with the second array ( combo0 [ 1 ] in the fiddle ) The reason for the callback is that I need to 'wait ' for the cycling effect to complete , and then move on.The issueWhile this does exactly what I need ( and besides the fact that I 'm highly doubtful if this is the way to do it ; I always feel a bit odd when writing a function that loops itself ) , I have the following problem : In the combo arrays , I define which of the 'sentence ' arrays can be possible combinations . This works fine if there are two combinations , but with more than two , I have a problem : I would have to recursively rewrite this to accommodate the possibility of a combo array consisting of 3 or even 4 options . And probably this will break the script if a combo array contains just 2 ( or 1 ) arrays.This is where I 'm stuck . The main issue is that if I loop over the combo array , e.g . with an .each ( ) ; , the generate function is called multiple times synchronously , so the whole 'cycling ' effect is lost.I have tried writing various loops , which take into account the array length of the given combo array , but I have crashed more browsers today than ever before , and I ca n't work out what to do ."

"Let 's say I have a function that does a standard AJAX request : This code will cause the browser to start an AJAX request , but at what point in the function does the request actually start ? According to this post : https : //blog.raananweber.com/2015/06/17/no-there-are-no-race-conditions-in-javascript/ [ Calling xhr.onreadystate ( ) after send ( ) ] is possible , because the HTTP request is only executed after the current scope has ended its tasks . This enables the programmer to set the callbacks at any position he wishes . As JavaScript is single-threaded , the request can only be sent when this one single thread is free to run new tasks . The HTTP request is added to the list of tasks to be executed , that is managed by the engine.But when I add a breakpoint in devtools right after the send call : I do get a network request , albeit in a pending state : At the breakpoint , the XHR 's readystate is 1 , which is XMLHttpRequest.OPENED . According to MDN 's documentation , XMLHttpRequest.OPENED means that xhr.open ( ) has been called : https : //developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/readyStateBut if I comment out xhr.send ( ) so that only .open ( ) is called : Then I get no pending network request : Thinking that perhaps I need the function scope to end in order for the request to actually be sent out , I moved the breakpoint to after the function call ( and modified the code a bit to see the XHR readyState ) : But I still get the pending network request : It seems like the debugger not only freezes code execution , but also any network requests . This makes sense , as you do n't want network requests to complete while you 're on a breakpoint , but this also makes it impossible to tell when the network request is actually initiated.My question is , at what point does the request actually get sent out ? Does calling xhr.send ( ) merely set up the request , but requires that the function scope end before the request is initiated ? Does xhr.send ( ) immediately initiate the request before the function scope ends ? Or is there something else going on here ?"

"Let 's start with a definition : A transducer is a function that takes a reducer function and returns a reducer function.A reducer is a binary function that takes an accumulator and a value and returns an accumulator . A reducer can be executed with a reduce function ( note : all function are curried but I 've cat out this as well as definitions for pipe and compose for the sake of readability - you can see them in live demo ) : With reduce we can implement map and filter functions : As we can see there 're a few similarities between map and filter and both of those functions work only with arrays . Another disadvantage is that when we compose those two functions , in each step a temporary array is created that gets passed to another function.Transducers help us solve that concerns : when we use a transducer there are no temporary arrays created and we can generalize our functions to work not only with arrays . Transducers need a transduce function to work Transducers are generally executed by passing to transduce function : We can even define array map and filter using transducer because it 's so composable : live version if you 'd like to run the code - > https : //runkit.com/marzelin/transducersDoes my reasoning makes sense ?"

"I have normally learned that function implementation can have any name for function arguments as long as it is supplied in the right order . This makes the function abstracted from the outside world and the local names have no effect on the output . Implementer has all the rights for local variables . However in Angular JS , it seems to counter intuitive to have something like : If I put `` bar '' there instead `` $ scope '' I get an error . This is not the normal function that we are used to . I believe it something to do with DI , but can anyone explain this concept ? I find it hard to call this a `` function '' because it is dependent on the outside world - especially the argument name .If DI is the real reason , can any one let me know how does it get invoked ? Normally I can think of DI doing good when I want to mock an object for test case . In this case what role does DI play ? In the normal scenarios of DI that I have come across , the argument that gets passed , does a service for the function like say foo displayTime ( clock ) { clock.something } . Time is just a service for the the function . However here I find that , the $ scope and the framework seems to do the magic with the function just being declarative way of expressing the logic . Edit : Apparently JS minify breaks this functionality and we need to do like in How do the function argument names in Angular.js objects connect to other objects ?"

When the state changes , I would like to reset the currentNameIndex to zero . What is the best way to do this ? Options I have conciderred : Using componentDidUpdateThis solution is ackward , because componentDidUpdate runs after render , so I need to add a clausein the render method to `` do nothing '' while the component is in an invalid state , if I am not careful , I can cause a null-pointer-exception . I have included an implementation of this below . Using getDerivedStateFromPropsThe getDerivedStateFromProps method is static and the signature only gives you access to the current state and next props . This is a problem because you can not tell if the props have changed . Asa result , this forces you to copy the props into the state so that you can check if they are the same . Making the component `` fully controlled '' I do n't want to do this . This component should privately own what the currently selected index is .

I had the idea to write strings as plurals and then use substr to cut the last character off , conditionally : It 's fine - it does what I wanted . But looking at the MDN docs for String.prototype.slice ( ) , I thought I had found a way to make it even shorter , by using passing negative zero as the second argument to the function . From the docs : endSliceOptional . The zero-based index at which to end extraction . If omitted , slice ( ) extracts to the end of the string . If negative , it is treated as sourceLength + endSlice where sourceLength is the length of the string ( for example , if endSlice is -3 it is treated as sourceLength - 3 ) .This evaluates to .slice ( 0 , -1 ) when counter is equal to 1 , which would chop the last letter from the string , or it would otherwise evaluate to .slice ( 0 , -0 ) , which according to the docs should mean 0 characters were subtracted from the length of the string being operated upon.As it happens , -0 is treated the same as +0 by String.prototype.slice . I wondered if this was a convention , to treat -0 as being the same as +0 ( I know , for instance , -0 === +0 evaluates to true ) . I thought to look at String.prototype.substr , but +0 and -0 are supposed to be handled the same way in that function.Does anyone have any greater insight into this ? Is there some basic convention in the language design that states that , while signed zero is a language feature , it should be ignored , except in certain scenarios ( like 1/-0 ) ? tl ; dr I 'm salty that I ca n't make jokes about winning code golf by slicing ."
"Considering that you have this situation : The element .componentB has a directive called move-to which does simply move the contents of this element , collecting them with a jQuery children wildcard selector ( like var contents = $ ( '.componentB ' ) .find ( ' > * ' ) ; ) , when any of those breakpoints , defined on the breakpoints directive ( those numbers are the indexes of one array , that keeps the breakpoints measurements ) are currently occurring.When some breakpoint of that directive is active , the DOM change to this : This is a responsive mechanism is being used in a static version of one website that I 'm dealing with . What I need is to know if there 's flaws with the scope inheritance , event broadcasting , state controller , which is being related to the div.main , which is itself a sibling of the div.auxiliary.Wondering on how angular does it 's job , I suppose that the JS logic layer keeps relations between the DOM element being referenced on some scope . Mainly on directive scopes , using link ( ) functions , which are post-link ( ) by nature so DOM manipulation is more secure , because the link was already made.Keep in mind that I keep references of the .componentB contents inside the link ( ) function , while listening to the scope $ destroy event , to clear things up , avoiding memory leaks . Also because this system listens to $ window.on ( 'resize ' ) to find out which is the current breakpoint and , during the navigation , it 's possible that the contents of my example can be moved between their original container and the auxiliary one.So , the question is : if I move one element through DOM , even outside it 's ui-view parent , it 's safe to keep counting on variable updates on data-bindings , inheritances , and so on ? I 'm asking this before implementing because of the huge size of the application , and as always on production-wise runnings , there was no room to discuss this before ... Edit 1 : Temporarily , this CodePen has more chances : http : //codepen.io/anon/pen/JXPvBE ? editors=0010The code is doing what I need , but I need to test it inside the final app ."
"I 'm trying to build a regular expression that places a limit on the input length , but not all characters count equal in this length . I 'll put the rationale at the bottom of the question . As a simple example , let 's limit the maximum length to 12 and allow only a and b , but b counts for 3 characters.Allowed are : aa ( anything less than 12 is fine ) .aaaaaaaaaaaa ( exactly 12 is fine ) .aaabaaab ( 6 + 2 * 3 = 12 , which is fine ) .abaaaaab ( still 6 + 2 * 3 = 12 ) .Disallowed is : aaaaaaaaaaaaa ( 13 a 's ) .bbbba ( 1 + 4 * 3 = 13 , which is too much ) .baaaaaaab ( 7 + 2 * 3 = 13 , which is too much ) .I 've made an attempt that gets fairly close : This matches on up to 4 clusters that may consist of 0-3 a 's or one b.However , it fails to match on my last positive example : abaaaaab , because that forces the first cluster to be the single a at the beginning , consumes a second cluster for the b , then leaves only 2 more clusters for the rest , aaaaab , which is too long.ConstraintsMust run in JavaScript . This regex is supplied to Qt , which apparently uses JavaScript 's syntax.Does n't really need to be fast . In the end it 'll only be applied to strings of up to 40 characters . I hope it validates within 50ms or so , but slightly slower is acceptable.RationaleWhy do I need to do this with a regular expression ? It 's for a user interface in Qt via PyQt and QML . The user can type a name in a text field here for a profile . This profile name is url-encoded ( special characters are replaced by % XX ) , and then saved on the user 's file system . We encounter problems when the user types a lot of special characters , such as Chinese , which then encode to a very long file name . Turns out that at somewhere like 17 characters , this file name becomes too long for some file systems . The URL-encoding encodes as UTF-8 , which has up to 4 bytes per character , resulting in up to 12 characters in the file name ( as each of these gets percent-encoded ) .16 characters is too short for profile names . Even some of our default names exceed that . We need a variable limit based on these special characters.Qt normally allows you to specify a Validator to determine which values are acceptable in a text box . We tried implementing such a validator , but that resulted in a segfault upstream , due to a bug in PyQt . It ca n't seem to handle custom Validator implementations at the moment . However , PyQt also exposes three built-in validators . Two apply only to numbers . The third is a regex validator that allows you to put a regular expression that matches all valid strings . Hence the need for this regular expression ."

"ProblemI 'm trying to scan a drive directory ( recursively walk all the paths ) and write all the paths to a file ( as it 's finding them ) using fs.createWriteStream in order to keep the memory usage low , but it does n't work , the memory usage reaches 2GB during the scan.ExpectedI was expecting fs.createWriteStream to automatically handle memory/disk usage at all times , keeping memory usage at a minimum with back-pressure . CodeIs it because I 'm not using .pipe ( ) ? I tried creating a new Stream.Readable ( { read { } } ) and then inside the .on ( 'path ' emitter pushing paths into it with readable.push ( path ) but that did n't really work.UPDATE : Method 2 : I tried the proposed in the answers drain method but it does n't help much , it does reduce memory usage to 500mb ( which is still too much for a stream ) but it slows down the code significantly ( from seconds to minutes ) Method 3 : I also tried using readdirp , it uses even less memory ( ~400mb ) and is faster but I do n't know how to pause it and use the drain method there to reduce the memory usage further : Method 4 : I also tried doing this operation with a custom recursive walker , and even though it uses only 30mb of memory , which is what I wanted , but it is like 10 times slower than the readdirp method and it is synchronous which is undesirable :"

"I recently used a little utility library by John Resig , called inherit.js . I usually try to understand the core parts of the libraries I am using , and after a lot of head scratching I finally understood the hard bits of the code ( namely how he could call the corresponding method of the super class ) .The 1 % bit I do not get is related to a regexThe regex /xyz/ is tested against a function . Both MSDN and MDN state that test takes a string as the argument . No mention of a function , but since there are no errors in the console , I guess it must fly , but how does it work ? The next WTF is that the function body is xyz ; . This function can not be executed , because it would otherwise result in a `` ReferenceError : xyz is not defined '' . Right ? So what does it do ? If the result of the test is true , then fnTest is equal to a regex which checks for _super on a word boundary , else a regex that matches on anything . Double WTF ; again how and why . Later on there is a related bit of code , where this regex is being used.The bit I am wondering about here is fnTest.test ( prop [ name ] ) . I understand all the other tests , which check if the property exists , is a function , etc , but not what the regex test does . Anyone ?"

"I 've developed a JavaScript plugin to be included on our customers ' websites . The plugin I 've created depends on some external libraries , which are bundled and delivered to the client as one big package : jQuery 1.8.2 and KnockoutJS v3.0.0.The plugin plays fine on most sites , but if the host site uses RequireJS , my package fails to load because KnockoutJS automatically detects that RequireJS exists and attempts to use it . Here is the error that gets thrown : Obviously , I 've found an `` explanation '' of the error message on the RequireJS site . Unfortunately , I do n't understand how to avoid it . In my local copy of the KnockoutJS library , I 've found the offending line : If I manually edit this file so that condition [ 2 ] never executes and only condition [ 3 ] every executes , then everything works fine .

It just so happens that one of our customers that is trying to use my library DOES use RequireJS and when my library gets included , KnockoutJS ( bundled with my library , but NOT already on the host site ) throws an exception because it thinks it needs to register itself with RequireJS ( or at least that 's my speculation as to the exception ) .While , in principal , I 'm not opposed to loading the libraries my code depends on on demand , the truth is that it will create a slow , poor experience for my users as it will take additional request/response cycles to load them ."

"I am trying to grasp how the trie and such in immutability is implemented , as relates to immutability in JS .

I 'll try it two different ways : That one is just added as a leaf node.That one is added in the middle of a path.I am wondering what the immutable data structure would be to handle these 2 situations . So essentially we have a function f : graph - > graph ' that changes the graph into a `` new graph '' , when under the hood it should only be making a small adjustment to the data structure . Not sure how this would look or how it works . My first attempt at an explanation would be something like this ... It starts of in a wrapper object which is like ImmutableJS 's API layer on top of the JS objects.Then you make the change and it creates a new wrapper object.Then likewise for the second example : The boxes are the API objects you use , and the graphs inside are the plain JS data objects.But in these examples the original graph structure is modified ( placing a link to h in the first example , and placing an o placeholder in the second one ) . So I 'm wondering how specifically you would make these things immutable . Every change I make to the graph I would like to `` return a new object '' , but under the hood there is optimal structural sharing.Thank you for your help ."

"Consider the following typical React document structure : Component.jsxWhere these components are composed as follows : OuterClickableArea.jsWith , for the sake of this argument , InnerClickableArea.js having pretty much the same code except for the class name and the console log statement.Now if you were to run this app and a user would click on the inner clickable area , the following would happen ( as expected ) : outer area registers mouse event handlersinner area registers mouse event handlersuser presses mouse down in the inner areainner area 's mouseDown listener triggersouter area 's mouseDown listener triggersuser releases mouse upinner area 's mouseUp listener triggersconsole logs `` inner area click '' outer area 's mouseUp listener triggersconsole logs `` outer area click '' This displays typical event bubbling/propagation -- no surprises so far.It will output : Now , what if we are creating an app where only a single interaction can happen at a time ? For example , imagine an editor where elements could be selected with mouse clicks . When pressed inside the inner area , we would only want to select the inner element.The simple and obvious solution would be to add a stopPropagation inside the InnerArea component : InnerClickableArea.jsThis works as expected . It will output : The problem ? InnerClickableArea hereby implicitly chose for OuterClickableArea ( and all other parents ) not to be able to receive an event . Even though InnerClickableArea is not supposed to know about the existence of OuterClickableArea . Just like OuterClickableArea does not know about InnerClickableArea ( following separation of concerns and reusability concepts ) . We created an implicit dependency between the two components where OuterClickableArea `` knows '' that it wo n't mistakenly have its listeners fired because it `` remembers '' that InnerClickableArea would stop any event propagation . This seems wrong.I 'm trying not to use stopPropagation to make the app more scalable , because it would be easier to add new features that rely on events without having to remember which components use stopPropagation at which time.Instead , I would like to make the above logic more declarative , e.g . by defining declaratively inside Component.jsx whether each of the areas is currently clickable or not . I would make it app state aware , passing down whether the areas are clickable or not , and rename it to Container.jsx . Something like this : Container.jsxWhere this.props.setInteractionBusy is a redux action that would cause the app state to be updated . Also , this container would have the app state mapped to its props ( not shown above ) , so this.state.ineractionBusy will be defined.OuterClickableArea.js ( almost same for InnerClickableArea.js ) The problem is that the Javascript event loop seems to run these operations in the following order : both OuterClickableArea and InnerClickableArea are created with prop clickable equal to true ( because app state interactionBusy defaults to false ) outer area registers mouse event handlersinner area registers mouse event handlersuser presses mouse down in the inner areainner area 's mouseDown listener triggersinner area 's onClicking is firedcontainer runs 'setInteractionBusy ' actionredux app state interactionBusy is set to trueouter area 's mouseDown listener triggers ( it 's clickable prop is still true because even though the app state interactionBusy is true , react did not yet cause a re-render ; the render operation is put at the end of the Javascript event loop ) user releases mouse upinner area 's mouseUp listener triggersconsole logs `` inner area click '' outer area 's mouseUp listener triggersconsole logs `` outer area click '' react re-renders Component.jsx and passes in clickable as false to both components , but by now this is too lateThis will output : Whereas the desired output is : App state , therefore , does not help in trying to make these components more independent and reusable . The reason seems to be that even though the state is updated , the container only re-renders at the end of the event loop , and the mouse event propagation triggers are already queued in the event loop.My question , therefore , is : is there an alternative to using app state to be able to work with mouse event propagation in a declarative manner , or is there a better way to implement/execute my above setup with app ( redux ) state ?"

"I am implementing a turing machine ( think of it as a virtual machine ) in Javascript . I 'm working on a routine which is to perform the calculations as efficiently as possible ( this was not a focus of the project from the outset ) . Yes , I should not be thinking about optimizing unless I run into performance issues . But the nature of what I 'm doing ( where most non-trivial programs have very inefficient asymptotic runtimes ) means that there will always be something to gain from optimizing . I want to do the best I can to get as many instructions per second as ( reasonably ) possible.The solution is clear if I was programming in C++ for instance . Do some timing . gprof . -O3 etc . I would be studying the architectures I expect the code to be run on , and probably also peek at the assembly being generated.Ca n't do that with javascript , though . My first instinct is to reduce the operations in the inner loop to array lookups . It seems to me that it 's a good bet I will be able to take advantage of CPU cache performance if the interpreter is able to translate it to a ( hopefully short ) series of integer operations.A turing machine is very simple . It is in fact the most simple formulation of computation that exists ( ! ) : It has a finite number of states , a bidirectionally infinite tape , a tape head that can move one unit in either direction , and can read and write a single character to the tape . A program is encoded in a transition function which takes a state and a character that is read , and with that information provides the character to write , the direction to move the head , and the new state . This is the logic each step : The process happens in a loop . It seems clear to me the tape would be an array . I imagine that storing ( appending ) values to the end of an array is at least an amortized constant time operation with Javascript arrays . It is much less clear that appending to the front of an array would also have great performance , so I will probably want to use two arrays , one extending left , and one extending right . Problem is , that would in the naive implementation insert a conditional statement in the inner loop . I 'm not liking that . There must already be a conditional check anyway to check if the state is the halting state . So maybe it wo n't be so bad . There is also one more potential optimization which could eliminate indexing into alph_index by storing the index in the alphabet rather than the alphabet value itself on the tape . But the the main problem is this . What other things could I possibly do to make it faster ? Is it possible to make it any faster at all ? I do n't know what component of the execution will be the bottleneck ( CPU or I/O , or something else ? ) and I do n't know how I might go about finding that out . With Javascript I have hash tables at my disposal , too , but it seems like arrays would always be faster . Perhaps I am prematurely seeking advice . I will come back and edit with performance numbers as I make progress . As a reward for reading my question I will provide a link to a live work-in-progress version of my project : http : //stevenlu.net/tm.htmlIts operation has so far been to manipulate a div filled with spans which represents the tape . It also performs a ton of operations on strings and also does a lot of copying around of elements that is entirely unnecessary where the actual computation of the turing machine is concerned . But even so it achieves decent performance . It took about a minute on my machine to calculate 600,000 or so steps ( 5^4 = 625 ) , which is 10,000 steps per second . Which is n't so bad , but I know I can probably achieve more than a million per second with some lower level programming . Looking at benchmark perf here for previous-gen CPU 's I 'm seeing about 10,000 MIPS per core . I estimate therefore that if I can get my inner loop running once in the time it takes to run 50 Dhrystone iterations ( which seems very possible with a simple C implementation even though I have no idea what those synthetic benchmarks actually do ) , barring memory bandwidth limitations , I 've got 200 million iterations per second on one thread . My 600k step calculation would be completed in 3ms ! ! Well , if I can get my 5^4 computation to run without the browser reporting to me that it 's hung up , I 'll be pretty happy ... UPDATEWith a more efficient javascript implementation of the algorithm completed , the computation of 9^4 = 6561 , taking 58202209 steps , took 6173 ms to compute . That 's 9.4 million steps per second . Almost a 1,000 fold increase from my original DOM dependent method . The original 5^4 computation ( which took about 30 seconds even without scrolling the tape ) is now completed in 84 ms ."

"Fire up your firebug console and try this out.Compare this : to this : Notice the difference ? If thisx is undefined , it will immediatly throw a reference error . If x is an undefined property of this , jQuery will return the document as it 's result set instead . Next jQuery will attempt to remove your document ( which it ca n't ) , but before doing that it will remove all data attached to any child element of the document . Thus , wiping out your data store.Note : this can be any element reference or object . You only need to have jQuery attempt to access an undefined property . ( Talk about a pain . It fails silently , and I 'm trying to figure out why my data is suddenly missing . I track it down to a special case where an element reference was undefined in a specific situation . ) So on to my questions:1 ) Before I submit a bug report , am I analyzing this correctly ? Also if someone happens to know that this is a known issue , let me know . I could n't find it in the bug tracker , but the interface is n't that great ( or maybe I have this wrong ) .2 ) Why is there ultimately any difference ?

"Say I have the following HTML ( condensed ) : I want to remove the lowest child elements first , until ultimately removing the parent , then move on to the next parent element and its children . This can be easily accomplished by a simple loop that goes through each child element , removes it , then removes the next child element ( i.e . parent of the previous child ) : The problem with this , however , is that it removes the child elements from the lowest parent element first . If you were to run this code with my test markup , you could see what I mean.I want to remove the child elements from the top most parent , then work my way down , therefore reversing the order of the above code . I was able to somewhat accomplish this with the following code : The problem with this code , however , is that it only reverses the order of deleting with respect to the parent element . If there are multiple child elements within a parent , it will still delete them in the default ascending order ( bottom to top ) .My question , therefore , is how can I delete all the elements in descending order , regardless of how many child elements there are , in a much cleaner fashion ? There has to be a much better approach than what I attempted . jQuery is n't a requirement either . The reason for the setTimeouts is because I need a delay between removing the elements . As usual , I probably overlooked something relatively simple , so bear with me.To reiterate , if the HTML looks like this : I would want it to be deleted in the following order : Child 1Child 2Child 3Child 4"

"This is a continuation from my previous question.I managed to fixed the `` animation pauses every continuous keystrokes '' by adding a condition e.which === 13 , which detects and animate when the Enter key is pressed.This is how the previous one works : As you can see , after entering a newline then a continues of keystrokes , the animation lags , which means the animation executes on every keystrokes.These is the modified one , that will only animate after the Enter is pressed : It works smoothly ( it lags a bit though during the recording ) .These is how it works when deleting every character ( not long press ) : As you can see , it did n't animate well , because as you delete every character continuously , the animation pauses , just like the first attempt.So what I 'm trying to achieve now is the reverse one , animate smoothly after deleting a newline.Here 's a live code : How can I achieve a smooth animation on deleting a newline , or how to animate only when a newline is deleted ?"

"In our team of JavaScript devs we have embraced redux/react style of writing pure functional code . However , we do seem to have trouble unit testing our code . Consider the following example : This function call depends on calls to process , extractBar and extractBaz , each of which can call other functions . Together , they might require a non-trivial mock for data parameter to be constructed for testing.Should we accept the necessity of crafting such a mock object and actually do so in tests , we quickly find we have test cases that are hard to read and maintain . Furthermore , it very likely leads to testing the same thing over and over , as unit tests for process , extractBar and extractBaz should probably also be written . Testing for each possible edge case implemented by these functions via to foo interface is unwieldy.We have a few solutions in mind , but do n't really like any , as neither seems like a pattern we have previously seen.Solution 1 : Solution 2 : Solution 2 pollutes foo method signature very quickly as the number of dependent function calls rises.Solution 3 : Just accept the fact that foo is a complicated compound operation and test it as a whole . All the drawbacks apply.Please , suggest other possibilities . I imagine this is a problem that the functional programming community must have solved in one way or another ."

"I am working on a parser combinator library in JavaScript .

I want to build a proxy that detects changes to an object : New properties are defined.Existing properties are changed.Code Sample 1 - definePropertyCode Sample 1 - Observationsproxy has a property name which is what I 'd expect.Changing the name property tells me that name has been defined ; not what I 'd expect.Defining the age property tells me that age has been defined ; as I 'd expect.Code Sample 2 - setCode Sample 2 - Observationsproxy has a property name which is what I 'd expect.Changing the name property tells me that name has been changed ; as I 'd expect.Defining the age property tells me that age has been changed ; not what I 'd expect.QuestionsWhy does defineProperty catch property changes ? Why does the addition of set override defineProperty ? How do I get the proxy to correctly trap defineProperty for new properties and set for property changes ?

If not , then where does `` year '' get added and why is it available to both `` car '' and `` car1 '' ?

"In the minimal example below , the replacement of old content is deferred by setTimeout to give the user time to finish viewing it .

"I can claim that 'this ' keyword is the most confusing part of Javascript for those who comes from languages like C # .I have read a lot about this on the internet and on StackOverflow too . like here and here.I know that 'this ' keyword will be bound to the context . and in constructor function it will be bound to the object being created , and when there is no immediate context it will bound to global object ( i.e window ) I know all that , however confusion is still not fully cleared ; So the best way to understand is by testing codes.So I decided to write small code and I was surprised by how much convoluted the this keyword.here is the code i tested : as expected the alert window will show ( Hiiiiii May ) then ( wallace ) . Notice now that the line sayHi ( `` John '' ) ; has no effect at all.and Now the confusion will start when I change one thing ONLY ( change var tt = > this.tt ) : the result surprised me when the alert mthod gave ( Hiiiiiii May ) and then ( John ) not ( wallace ) ; so I had the idea to comment the line sayHi ( `` John '' ) ; but that resulted in the whole code being no-functional and not working.the demo is hereI know this might be newbee question . But it is really confusing here and I did try to read many articles and SO questions but i m missing this point.Why does the line sayHi ( `` John '' ) ; setting the hi2.ss to John ? ? and why does it break the code when we delete it ; although we invoke the sayHi method by using the new keyword afterward ? ?"

"So I was fooling around with the new exponentiation operator and I discovered you can not put a unary operator immediately before the base number.From the documentation on MDN : In JavaScript , it is impossible to write an ambiguous exponentiation expression , i.e . you can not put a unary operator ( +/-/~/ ! /delete/void/typeof ) immediately before the base number.In most languages like PHP and Python and others that have an exponentiation operator ( typically ^ or ** ) , the exponentiation operator is defined to have a higher precedence than unary operators such as unary + and unary - , but there are a few exceptions . For example , in Bash the ** operator is defined to have a lower precedence than unary operators.I understand this was made an error by design . I do n't understand this design decision . Who 's really going to be surprised that -x ** 2 is negative ? This follows not only other mainstream programming languages but a mathematical notation that has been in common use for hundreds of years and is taught to every high school algebra student.In Javascript ' 1'+ 2 is '12 ' and ' 1'-2 is -1 but -1**2 raises an error because it could be ambiguous ?

"It 's better to write code that does n't rely on the timing of immediate callbacks ( like microtasks vs macrotasks ) , but let 's put that aside for the moment.setTimeout queues a macrotask , which , at a minimum , waits to start until all microtasks ( and microtasks that they spawn ) finish . Here 's an example : The behavior of a .then on a resolved Promise is fundamentally different from the behavior of an immediate setTimeout callback - the Promise .then will run first , even if the setTimeout was queued first . But only modern browsers support Promises . How can the special functionality of a microtask be properly polyfilled if Promise does n't exist ? If you try to imitate a .then 's microtask by using setTimeout , you 'll be queuing a macrotask , not a microtask , so the badly-polyfilled .then wo n't run at the right time if a macrotask is already queued.There 's a solution using MutationObserver , but it looks ugly , and is n't what MutationObserver is for . Also , MutationObserver is not supported on IE10 and earlier . If one wants to queue a microtask in an environment that does n't natively support Promises , are there any better alternatives ?

"ScenarioI have web interface ( in a large web application ) that allows a user to make a connection between two very large lists.List A - 40,000+ itemsList B - 1,000+ itemsList C - Contains a list of items in b that are connected to the selected item in list AThe CodeHere is a rough jsfiddle of the current behavior minus the ajax update of the database.Here is the primary functionality ( only here because stack overflow requires a code snippet for jsfiddle links ) .The ProblemThe requirements do not allow for me to use an auto complete field or pager . But the current page takes way too long to load ( between 1 and 5sec depending on caching ) . Also the JS behaviors are attached to all 40k+ items which will cause problems on lower performance computers ( Tested on a newish $ 200 consumer special and the computer was crippled by the JS ) . There is also ( not on JS fiddle but the final product ) a filter that filters the list down based on text input.The QuestionWhat is a good strategy for handling this scenario ? My IdeaMy first thought was to create a sort of document view architecture . A JavaScript list that adds items to the top and bottom as the user scrolls and dumps items off the other end when the list reaches a certain size . To filter I would dump the whole list and obtain a new list of filtered items like an auto-complete but it would be able to scroll and add items using ajax . But this is very complicated . I was hoping someone might have a better idea or a jquery plugin that already uses this approach.UpdateLista is 70K FixedListb is User generated and will span between 1k-70k.That said just optimizing the JS with the excellent feedback of using delegates ( which will make life 10x more awesome ) , wo n't be enough . Still need to limit the visible list.Your Ideas ?"

"What is the contexte ? I have a website , which is a single page , where I will present my activity and projectsAfter scrolling few sections we have a projects in a row.What I want to do ?

"I 've recently discovered an awesome ng-describe package that makes writing unit tests for AngularJS applications very transparent by abstracting away all of the boilerplate code you have to remember/look up and write in order to load , inject , mock or spy.Has somebody tried to use ng-describe with protractor ? Does it make sense and can we benefit from it ? One of the things that caught my eye is how easy you can mock the HTTP responses : Mocking HTTP responses usually helps to achieve a better e2e coverage and test how does UI reacts to specific situations and how does the error-handling work . This is something we are currently doing with protractor-http-mock , there are also other options which do n't look as easy as it is with ng-describe ."

"Here is a naive implementation of a right fold : This is non-tail recursion and hence we can not apply a trampoline .

"I 'm working with an application that uses DataTables to generate a HTML table which is populated by data from an ajax request.This is fairly simple : There is a callback which DataTables provides , called rowCallback ( https : //datatables.net/reference/option/rowCallback ) which allows post processing of table rows after the table has been drawn . The key thing here is that it 's after the ajax request to /get-substances.json ; the table must be populated with data because this callback is used to manipulate data within it at that point . Within rowCallback I 'm providing an array of row ID 's in my table - that is to say ID 's which correspond to < tr > elements inside # substancesTable - and I go on to expand these rows . I can do this manually by hardcoding in an array of row ID 's , e.g.The array I 've hardcoded means rows 4 and 7 are expanded after the table has been populated , which is equivalent to the user clicking on them . The problem I have is that I do n't want to hardcode the array . The application stores the equivalent of var index in Redis ( cache ) meaning that we can grab the data easily even if the user leaves the page . So I have added a second ajax request ( outside the var substancesTable ... block ) to obtain the Redis data . This makes an ajax request to populate an array , activeRows : I understand that the nature of ajax means my code is asynchronous . In some cases the ajax request shown above will complete before the DataTable is drawn , so I get the console.log ( activeRows ) appearing before the table is rendered , and in other cases it happens afterwards.What is the correct way to make this second ajax request such that the values from it can be used in place of the hardcoded array ? I appreciate I will need to convert the response to an array ( since it 's still JSON in the console.log statement ) . But my question is focused on where to put this code such that it can be used reliably inside rowCallback ? I have read How do I return the response from an asynchronous call ? and understand about the async nature . I ca n't work out how to structure this to be used in a callback that 's already part of an ajax request.The application uses DataTables version 1.10.16 and jquery 3.2.1"

"I 'm kinda a newbie at regular expressions , so would appreciate a bit of peer feedback on this one . It will be heavily used on my site , so any weird edge cases can totally wreak havoc . The idea is to type in an amount of an ingredient in a recipe in whole units or fractions . Due to my autocomplete mechanism , just a number is valid too ( since it 'll pop up a dropdown ) . These lines are valid : The numeric part of the line should be its own group so I can parse that with my fraction parser . Everything after the numeric part should be a second group . At first , I tried this : This almost works , but `` 1 1/2 cups '' will get parsed as ( 1 ) ( 1/2 cups ) instead of ( 1 1/2 ) and ( cups ) . After scratching my head a bit , I determined this was because of the ordering of my `` OR '' clause . ( 1 ) satisfies the \d+ and ( . * ) satisfies the rest . So I changed this to : This almost works , but allows weirdness such as `` 1 1/2/4 cups '' or `` 1/2 3 cups '' . So I decided to enforce a letter as the first character after a valid numeric expression : Note I 'm running this in case-insensitive mode . Here 's my questions : Can the expression be improved ? I kinda do n't like the `` OR '' list for number , fraction , compound fraction but I could n't think of a way to allow whole numbers , fractions , or compound fractions.It would be extra nice if I could return a group for each word after the numeric component . Such as a group for ( 10 3/4 ) , a group for ( cups ) and a group for ( sliced ) . There can be any number of words after . Is this possible ? Thanks !"

"One of our page is very heavy . To decrease our watcher count and to accelerate the angular digest cycle we are using a lot the On-Time-Binding syntax : : . We are also using angular-bind-notifier to avoid unnecessary watchs over our expressions on this page . This strategy allowed us to reduce the angular digest cycle considerably . But this strategy has one down side : It uses the $ $ postDigest ( postDigestQueue ) to unwatch the expression after it has been evaluated successfully.So what ? At the end of the digest , angular will run through the postDigestQueue . As we used a lot of On-Time-Binding expressions , our postDigestQueue can grow up to more than 100 000 queued tasks.The problem is that angular uses the following code to loop over the queue : The shift method removes the element at the zeroeth index and shifts the values at consecutive indexes down , then returns the removed value . https : //developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shiftYes , Array.prototype.shift ( ) is a very expensive call when there is a lot of elements in the array.Our digest cycle will sometimes take more than 20 seconds because of that.When we change the previous code with the following one , it is way faster : Is there a reason why they did that ? Should n't we use that much the one time binding ? I could see one reason : if a task add itself a need task in the queue . Is is possible ? ( $ $ postDigest is a private queue ) An answer would be to use popinstead of shift if the order of execution is not important , but is it ? Edit : The order seems important because the postDigestQueue is used with the animations.If anyone is interested in possible official follow-ups , I opened an issue on the issue tracker ."

"EDIT : I 'm still not there yet . I have placed a bounty on this question because I could really do with the answer . I have made do with the idea of elements that represent the planets that do n't revolve around the center . Because of this , you can skip steps 1 & 2 and go straight to 3 to try to help me out.ORIGINAL : I am working on a fun little project . It 's a solar system in which planets revolve around the sun . I consider it a simulation that 's consistent of 3 big steps.First step : create a functional revolving Solar system with the 8 planets . Second step : create a function that adds new planets revolving around the same sun , with the click of a button with its specifics being based randomly ( ie : distance from the sun , color of the planet , size of the planet , etc . ) I 'm on the third step , and I do n't want things to be random anymore . The third step is for me by far the hardest one for me because I have little experience with JSON . I have data from all the exoplanets beyond our solar system from the NASA website , and I want to add these individal objects ( planets ) into the simulation with the function that adds the objects . My question to you is : How would my code need to look to have each individual record you see here in the JSON array in my code , as an element that 's placed away from the black speck on the center of the screen ( see the fiddle ) in a random angle , this so it 's not all aligned the same . In the end , I wish to have thousands of small specks that represent planets shown on the screen , where the black speck currently only visible , is to be the sun.This is because there are thousands of planets like this in my JSON file , and I want to see them all revolve with their respective distance from the sun `` Distance [ pc ] '' , their respective size `` Planet Radius [ Jupiter radii ] '' . Of course , the science would n't need to be accurate , but it should somewhat be . For example , the planet with the greatest Distance [ pc ] ( distance in parsec ) needs to be the farthest away , but still be able to be seen on the screen , even if it 's just a little speck . Now I am aware that some math is involved to appropiately position each planet based on the distance property , because they are listed as distance in parsec , some conversion method would be in order to place them all on the same screen , while they 're still visible.This is my code , but not all of it . To see all of it , click the link posted under this code . This fiddle holds the essential code . Note : this link has all of the 3000+ planets in the code , so it might act up on you in terms of loading . Simply type in 1 instead of 2 in the URL to go to the draft in which there are just a few examples of hte planets , if your browser is acting up on you ."

By triggering domready manually , we can cut off 100-300 ms of execution delay . This is a major deal , because we can rely on jQuery to take care of DOM manipulations before we see them.Now , to a question , I have never seen this being recommended or discussed before , but still it seems like a major performance issue . Everything is about optimizing the code itself , which is good of course , but it is in vain if the execution is delayed for such a long time that the user sees a `` flash of `` unjQueryedContent '' .Any ideas why this is not discussed/recommended more frequently ?"

"I am interested in validating or automatically correcting the use of the indefinite articles `` a '' and `` an '' in blocks of English text from a textarea.The grammatical rule is that the choice of article depends on the sound that begins the next word . Details here and here . This appears incredibly broad , however there has been a suggestion in a previous answer ( How can I correctly prefix a word with `` a '' and `` an '' ? ) to reference a huge database of English text to create the heuristics to infer the correct indefinite article to use in a given situation . Eamon Nerbonne comments that he has done this , so how can I apply that solution to this practical implementation ? The function I have so far implements the simplest part of the grammatical rule ; it uses an when the following word starts with a vowel , and a otherwise . It also respects the existing capitalization of the article . In actual use , though , this is n't practical because the exceptions to that rule are very common . For example , `` a horse '' is correct while `` a honour '' and `` a HTTP address '' are not.How can my function be expanded to properly handle actual pronunciation of words following the articles , including silent letters , acronyms , and `` sometimes-y '' ? I do n't require 100 % accuracy - something better than 80 % would be enough to improve the text I 'm correcting.Here 's my fixArticles ( ) function ; see the snippet for a running example.The expected output for the sample input is : A wise man once said : `` An apple a day keeps the doctor away .

"I 'm asking this more out of curiosity rather than really being concerned with it , but I 've been wondering whether or not the JavaScript event system violates the Liskov substitution principle ( LSP ) or not.By calling EventTarget.dispatchEvent , we may dispatch an Event of an arbitrary type that might get handled by a registered EventListener.If I understand the LSP correctly , it would mean that anyEventListener.handleEvent ( anyEvent ) should n't fail . However , that is usually not the case since event listeners will often use properties of specialized Event sub-types.In a typed language that does not support generics , that design would basically require downcasting the Event object to the expected sub-type in the EventListener.From my understanding , the above design as is could be considered a violation of the LSP . Am I correct or the simple fact of having to provide a type when registering a listener through EventTarget.addEventListener prevents the LSP violation ? EDIT : While everyone seems to be focusing on the fact that Event subclasses are n't violating the LSP , I was actually concerned about the fact that EventListener implementors would violate the LSP by strenthening the pre-conditions of the EventListener 's interface . Nothing in the void handleEvent ( in Event evt ) contract tells you that something may break by passing the wrong Event sub-type.In a strongly-typed language with generics that interface could be expressed as EventListener < T extends Event > so that the implementor can make the contract explicit e.g . SomeHandler implements EventListener < SomeEvent > .In JS there are obviously no actual interfaces , but event handlers still need to conform to the specification and there is nothing in that specification that allows a handler to tell whether or not it can handle a specific type of event.It 's not really an issue because listeners are n't expected to be invoked on their own , but rather invoked by the EventTarget on which it was registered and associated with a specific type.I 'm just interested about whether or not LSP is violated according to the theory . I wonder if to avoid the violation ( if theorically considered as such ) the contract would have needed to be something like the following ( even though it may have done more bad than good in terms of pragmatism ) :"

"Part of JavaScript 's automatic semicolon insertion algorithm is so-called `` restricted productions '' . These are syntactical forms which forbid a newline character from occurring at a certain point . To quote the ECMAScript 2015 specification : If the phrase “ [ no LineTerminator here ] ” appears in the right-hand side of a production of the syntactic grammar , it indicates that the production is a restricted production : it may not be used if a LineTerminator occurs in the input stream at the indicated position.There are 10 restricted productions in the ECMAScript 2015 specification : PostfixExpression [ Yield ] : LeftHandSideExpression [ ? Yield ] [ no LineTerminator here ] ++PostfixExpression [ Yield ] : LeftHandSideExpression [ ? Yield ] [ no LineTerminator here ] -- ContinueStatement [ Yield ] : continue [ no LineTerminator here ] LabelIdentifier [ ? Yield ] ; BreakStatement [ Yield ] : break [ no LineTerminator here ] LabelIdentifier [ ? Yield ] ; ReturnStatement [ Yield ] : return [ no LineTerminator here ] Expression ; ReturnStatement [ Yield ] : return [ no LineTerminator here ] Expression [ In , ? Yield ] ; ThrowStatement [ Yield ] : throw [ no LineTerminator here ] Expression [ In , ? Yield ] ; ArrowFunction [ In , Yield ] : ArrowParameters [ ? Yield ] [ no LineTerminator here ] = > ConciseBody [ ? In ] YieldExpression [ In ] : yield [ no LineTerminator here ] * AssignmentExpression [ ? In , Yield ] YieldExpression [ In ] : yield [ no LineTerminator here ] AssignmentExpression [ ? In , Yield ] Of these productions , I understand the choice to make most of them restricted . The production for PostfixExpression is restricted to prevent parsing ambiguity with PrefixExpression . ContinueStatement , BreakStatement , and ReturnStatement have restricted productions because there are corresponding productions where break and continue do not take labels and return does not take an expression . I ca n't say that I know enough about arrow functions or yield expressions to know why they are restricted , but I assume it is to prevent some sort of similar parsing ambiguity.The production which I do n't understand is ThrowExpression . As far as I can tell , there is no parsing ambiguity involved in using throw like there is when using break , return , and continue : after all , throw ; is not valid JavaScript . I thought that it might be for historical reasons , but as far as I can tell throw ; has never been allowed in any JavaScript specification.The practical consequence of this is that much like with return , you ca n't put the expression being thrown on the next line , e.g . this is wrong : However , unlike return , this does n't have different behavior than putting the new Error ( ) on the same line . It 's just a syntax error : Chrome reports it as Uncaught SyntaxError : Illegal newline after throwIs the production for ThrowExpression restricted just to maintain consistency with similar contstructs ? Or is there some ambiguity I 'm not seeing ?"
"I 'm looking for any indications whether or not `` superclassing '' a builtin type will work according to the specification . That is , given any hypothetical conformant implementation of ECMAScript , does `` superclassing '' a builtin break the runtime by affecting the creation algorithm of the class constructor ? `` Superclassable '' , a term I 'm coining , refers to a class whose objects returned by constructing it , or calling it as a function if applicable , will be created with the same internal slots ( except for [ [ Prototype ] ] ) , regardless of what its direct superclass is , as long as the initial [ [ Prototype ] ] of the class constructor and the class prototype are still in each respective inheritance chain after reassigning them . Consequently , in order to be `` superclassable '' , a class must not call super ( ) during creation.When `` superclassing '' an Array , I would expect it to look something like this : One of my biggest concerns is that internally , in a possibly conformant implementation , Array could potentially look like this , which would mean that Array is not `` superclassable '' : However , Array is `` superclassable '' if a conformant implementation is required not to call super ( ) : With that in mind , I 'd like to reference a few points from the current draft , ECMAScript 2018 : §22.1.1 The Array ConstructorThe Array constructor : creates and initializes a new Array exotic object when called as a constructor.is designed to be subclassable . It may be used as the value of an extends clause of a class definition . Subclass constructors that intend to inherit the exotic Array behaviour must include a super call to the Array constructor to initialize subclass instances that are Array exotic objects.§22.1.3 Properties of the Array Prototype ObjectThe Array prototype object has a [ [ Prototype ] ] internal slot whose value is the intrinsic object % ObjectPrototype % .The Array prototype object is specified to be an Array exotic object to ensure compatibility with ECMAScript code that was created prior to the ECMAScript 2015 specification . ( emphasis added ) My understanding is that a conformant implementation is not required to internally call super ( ) within the Array constructor in order to properly initialize the instance as an array exotic , nor does it require Object to be the direct superclass of Array ( though my first quote of §22.1.3 certainly seems to imply that bit ) .My question is , does the first snippet above work according to the specification , or does it only work because the currently existing implementations allow it to ? i.e . is the implementation of the first HypotheticalArray non-conformant ? And for full bounty award , I 'd also like to apply this question to String , Set , Map , and TypedArray ( by which I mean Object.getPrototypeOf ( Uint8Array.prototype ) .constructor ) .I will award 500 bounty points for the first answer that rigorously addresses my questions about the practice of `` superclassing '' the above builtins in ECMAScript 2015 and up ( the draft in which Object.setPrototypeOf ( ) was introduced ) .I do not intend to support ECMAScript edition 5.1 and below , as modifying a builtin 's inheritance chain is only possible by accessing __proto__ , which is not part of any ECMAScript specification and is therefore implementation-dependent.P.S . I am fully aware of the reasons that practices like this are discouraged , which is why I would like to determine if the specification allows for `` superclassing '' without `` breaking the web '' , as TC39 likes to say ."

"A friend of mine got bitten by the all too famous 'anonymous functions in loop ' javascript issues . ( It 's been explained to death on SO , and I 'm actually expecting someone to my question as a duplicate , which would probably be fair game ) . The issue amounts to what John Resig explained in this tutorial : http : //ejohn.org/apps/learn/ # 62To a new user it should work , but indeed `` i always have the same values '' , they say , hence crying and teeth gnashing.I explained the issue with a lot of hand waving and some stuff about scopes , and pointed him to some solutions provided on SO or other sites ( really , when you know it is such a common issue , google is your friend ) . Of course the real answer is that in JS the scope is at the function level . So when the anonymous functions run , ' i ' is not defined in the scope of any of them , but it is defined in the global scope , and it has the value of the end of the loop , 4 . Since we 've all most likely be trained in languages that use block-level scope , it 's yet-another-thing-that-js-does-a-little-bit-different-than-the-rest-of-the-world ( meaning of `` this '' , anyone ? ) What bogs me is that the common answer , actually even the one provided by John himself is the following : Which obviously works and demonstrate mastery of the language and a taste for nested parenthesis that suspiciously makes you look like a LISP-er.And yet I ca n't help thinking that other solutions would be much more readible and easier to explain . This one is just pushing the anonymous closure a bit closure closer to the setTimeout ( or closer to the addEventListener is 99.9 % of the case where it bites someone ) : This one is about explaining what we 're doing , with an explicit function factory : Finally , there is another solution that removes the problem altogether , and would seem even more natural to me ( although I agree that it somehow sidesteps the problem 'by accident ' ) Are those solutions entirely equivalent , in terms of memory usage , number of scope created , possible leaking ?

"Is it good practice to use a object literal as a hash table ? i.e use a property name as the key to get a particular mapped value back.For example : Is this an acceptable use for object literals , or is there a pattern out there that will better handle a hash map in JavaScript ?"
"Deferring the execution of functions , for example in custom event handling , is a common pattern in JavaScript ( see , for example here ) . It used to be that using setTimeout ( myFunc,0 ) was the only way to do this , however with promises there is now an alternative : Promise.resolve ( ) .then ( myFunc ) . I had assumed that these would pretty much do the same thing , but while working on a library which included custom events I thought I 'd find out if there was a difference , so I dropped the following block into node : I was expecting to see on the console 3 , 1 , 2 but instead I saw 3 , 2 , 1 . So in other words the Promise is NOT equivalent to using setTimeout and comes out of the blocks first . At least in Node . I repeated the test in Chrome and Firefox with the same result , however in Edge it came out as 3 , 1 , 2 . I would also expect non-native promise libraries to use setTimeout under the hood so would come out the same as Edge.What determines the order of these calls being resolved ? What model is used by these different environments to determine execution order ? Does any of the above represent standard or non-standard behaviour ? PS I 'm defniately not suggesting relying on any of this staying consistant , I 'm just curious.After the answer given below pointed me in the right direction , and as mentioned briefly in the comment below , I found the complete answer in an excellent article by Jake Archibald ( with an example almost identical to my code above ) which I though I 'd add up here rather than leaving it buried in a comment ."
"Currently , I am building a system , and I am having some trouble with the update function.Essentially , I am trying to add new nodes to a D3 tree . A new child node can be added when the user clicks the `` add button '' of a node . Each add button can be found on the left side of each node.I have followed Mike Bostock 's general update pattern . Once I click on the button , the only `` new '' data element should be the newly created child node , but it looks like the entire data is being treat as `` new '' . I came to this conclusion when I looked at the class names for each node and the obvious fact that there is a transition of all the nodes coming to the central node and disappearing . The other original data should be `` updated '' , but it 's not . Can anyone please gently point out as to why this is happening ? A working sample of my code can be found in this jfiddle link.EDIT 06/09Given Gordon 's suggestion , I have found a unique field for both of my nodes and link . So to uniquely identify the data I have made the following change : NODELINKThis change works ( mostly ) , but I see that some weird behaviors are still occurring : ( 1 ) Branch 7.2.1 is still being recognized a new node and disappear ; ( 2 ) links are not being properly aligned with their respective node after the second `` add '' or so . I think my two small edits are affecting this because when I went back to the original code , the lines are being properly drawn , despite the fact they 're transitioning away . Thoughts ? Advice ?

"For my 1st year students , I have provided a simple ES5-based library written using the Revealing Module Pattern . Here is a snippet of the `` main '' module/namespace , which will house other extensions : This works for pretty much 99.9 % of the students who are new to web-development and are not using fancy things like ES6 in combination with Webpack or Babel.The 0.1 % has now requested me to provide an ES6 based version , which can be imported properly . I 'd be happy to provide this , but I 'm kind of stuck on how to best approach this.I obviously want to keep the ES5 way , so my students can just include the file using a script-tag and type Library.SomeExtension.aFunction ( ) ; where-ever they please . On top of that , some of the extensions are reliant on jQuery , which gets injected in a similar way as the snippet above.I 'm now looking for some maintainable way to get the best of both worlds , with one code-base , with jQuery as a dependency . I want to give 99.9 % a window.Library , whereas I want to give the 0.1 % a way to use import Library from 'library'.Can I accomplish this with a single JS file that does both ? Or would I need a special ES6 version ( not a problem to do ) ? And most of all : How would I reshuffle my code ( all similar to above snippet ) in such a way I can support both situations ? Any and all pointers will be greatly appreciated ! EDIT : Just as a side note , I already have a gulpfile.js in place which runs this library through Babel , minifiers and other things .

"So this is a generic pattern question but one I have been going back and forth with for some time . Should a model have a save method in MV* ? I often jump back and forth between Knockout , Ember , and sometimes even Angular but one of the persistent questions I always have is should the model have a save method on it 's class or prototype that knows how to save changes to reduce dependencies around the application on services ( aka the model has a service for saving that all of the other view models / controllers inherit by knowing about the model ) or should there be a service that each of the view models / controllers depend on that has a specific method for saving changes to the object ? Example JavaScript pseudo-codevsBoth accomplish the same purpose of saving the person but in Example 1 the view model / controller does n't know about the service or how it is implemented only that if you want to change a person , you save it . In example two obviously we have to know about not only the way to save it but how the save is implemented.Please read this before you answer -I realize that this is an opinion-based question but if you can back up your opinion with facts it will be factual , so please have references to back up any claims so that this is not closed as 'Primarily opinion based '"

"Firstly , I 'm new to programming and Stackoverflow scares me , but I 've tried to contain all the relevant code and to explain my problem well . I have seen many other posts regarding people attempting to make Space Invaders clones and even specifically the `` invaders '' not moving in unison . However , these posts have not solved my problem and I would be really grateful if someone could point out where I may have gone wrong.The prototype is available here.Full code hereCode contains comments of me trying to dumb down the code : ) . I am using the `` processing.js '' library but this should n't hinder anyone from understanding my code.My specific problem is that the invaders ' behaviour when moving on the X axis is not consistent and they do not always move at the same time . At first it seems like everything is fine ( minus the very first invader being a bit laggy ) but over time the behaviour becomes erratic and they start to move out of line.I actually understand the flaw in my logic already , but I do not know how to solve it . However , before I explain..I load the space invaders into a 2d array like so : My enemy class is : They are drawn and moved in the `` draw '' ( basically processing.js 's version of `` update '' ) loop . Like so : Then ( where the problem most likely is ) I handle movement like so : Now , I believe/know that the problem is I am interating through the arrays and checking the first and last item to monitor the X position . Therefore , there will be some lag between the program changing the direction and with it finding an object that meets the criteria of the if/else statement . ( I hope that makes sense ) .I have thought of somehow creating a column object with its own independent X and Y axis and to contain the invaders in there . That way I do not need to rely on individual `` invaders '' triggering the if/else statement 's criteria . However , does anyone know another/easier approach or a different gap in my logic ?"

The main problem is that it downloads the files so fast , and places the files correctly fast enough that it just does n't update the loading bar unless I set a timeout interval of 300-400ms..it does log into console and I made an interval function that continously checks to see if a file is finished based on a global variable .

"I 'm trying to add an authorization layer to an API , and the current design I have results in more SQL queries than it feels like should be required , so I 'm wondering how I can simplify this.ContextHere 's the database schema for this piece of the problem : And the API endpoint in question is GET /users/ : user/teams , which returns all of the teams a user is a member of . Here 's what the controller for that route looks like : ( Note : all of this is Javascript , but it 's been sort of pseudocode 'd for clarity . ) Those four asynchronous functions are the core logical steps that need to happen for the authorization to be `` complete '' . Here 's what each of those functions roughly looks like : exists simply checks whether a user by that userId even exists in the database , and throws the proper error code if not.query is just pseudocode for running a SQL query with escaped variables.canFindTeams ensures that either the current user is the one making the request , or that the current user is a teammate of the user in question . Anyone else should not be authorized to find the user in question . In my real implementation , it 's actually done with roles that have associated actions , so that a teammate can teams.read but ca n't teams.admin unless they are an own . But I simplified that for this example.findTeams will actually query the database for the teams objects.maskTeams will return only the teams that a given user should see . This is needed because a user should be able to see all of their teams , but teammates should only be able to see their teams in common , so as to not leak information.ProblemsOne of the requirements that led me to break it up like this is that I need a way to throw those specific error codes , so that the errors returned to API clients are helpful . For example , the exists function runs before the canFindTeams function so that not everything errors with a 403 Unauthorized.Another , that 's not well communicated here in pseudocode , is that the currentUser can actually be an app ( a third-party client ) , a team ( an access token that pertains to the team itself ) or a user ( the common case ) . This requirement makes it difficult to implement the canFindTeams or the maskTeams function as single SQL statements , since the logic has to be forked three ways ... In my implementation , both functions are actually switch statements around the logic for handling all three cases—that the requester is an app , a team and a user.But even given those constraints , this feels like a lot of extra code to write to ensure all of these authentication requirements . I 'm worried about performance , code maintainability , and also about the fact that these queries are n't all in single transactions.QuestionsDo the extra queries meaningfully affect performance ? Can they be combined into fewer queries easily ? Is there a better design for the authorization that simplifies this ? Does not using transactions pose problems ? Anything else you 'd change ? Thanks !"

"TL ; DR ; To make it simple , how can I filter multiple properties of a parent child array which could be several tree level deep . This is for an Open Source datagrid lib used by several hundred users.So I have an array of parent/children references , the children can also have children themselves and so on , there 's no limit on the tree level depth . Also , I need to be able to filter from not just the property that has the tree structure but on any propertie ( s ) , that are columns in a grid , of that array . For example , I have this array , which is representing a file explorer listThe array looks flat but in reality , it 's a tree view structure that is represented in a datagrid as shown below.What I found that partially works is to loop through the entire array and add the full list of files that each item can have including itself , for example , if Documents has a child PDF which has itself has a child Map.pdf , then the tree mapping can be represented by [ `` Documents '' , `` PDF '' , `` map.pdf '' ] and we store that on the parent object , then on the next child we store [ `` PDF '' , `` map.pdf '' ] and finally on the last child we store [ `` map.pdf '' ] like soand this is the method allowing me to do thatThen the datagrid lib uses the Filter method which I can use this way , where columnFilters is an object containing 1 or more filter , for example const columnFilters = { file : 'map ' , size : ' > 3 ' } The datagrid is a lib ( SlickGrid ) and it uses the filter method like so dataView.setFilter ( treeFilter ) ; With the call of modifyDatasetToAddTreeMapping ( ) it works ok if I want to filter on the File column , but if I add more column filters , it does n't work as intended . For example if you take a look at the 2nd print screen , you see that I entered `` map '' and that will display the `` Documents > PDF > map.pdf '' and that is great but if add a file size lower than 3Mb it should n't display `` map.pdf '' and because that file is not shown and `` Documents > PDF '' do n't contain the word `` map '' then nothing should display , so as you can see the filter is not behaving as it should . So with the current implementation , I have 2 problems1 . not behaving correctly when a tree node is not displayed , the parent of it should n't be displayed 2. having to call modifyDatasetToAddTreeMapping ( ) is an extra call that might not be needed3 . it also modifies the source array , I could deep clone the array but that would be yet another expense in performanceThis might be doable by recursion , after converting to a hierarchical structure ( tree ) , but I ca n't figure out the best algorithm to do this if it 's with recursion , is n't it expensive to always drill down the tree to find items ? Lastly , the intention is to use this with SlickGrid which might have 10k or even 50k rows so it has to be fast . You can see this SlickGrid demo but their implementation of the filtering is not correct , also I found the method add the mapping in this other SO AnswerNOTE : I would also like to point out that a resolution to this issue will benefit possibly a few hundred ( or thousand ) users since it is to be implement in Angular-Slickgrid and Aurelia-Slickgrid which are both Open Source lib and used by at least 300+ users.Filtering with the word `` map '' should not return anything here since none of the nodes/children have that text.EDITThe best code would be to plug whatever code does the job into a regular JS filter , so that means the end solution would be a method myFilter that would be a filter callback method . The reason I 'm stuck with this is because I use an external lib SlickGrid and I have to use what that lib has available as public methods exposed . If I have const columnFilters = { file : `` map '' , size : `` < 3.2 '' } ; , the expected result of the array would be 4 linesIf I have const columnFilters = { file : `` map '' , size : `` < 3 '' } ; , the expected result of the array would be 3 linesand finally if I have const columnFilters = { file : `` map '' , size : `` > 3 '' } ; then the expected result would be an empty array because none of the file have that char and file size conditions.EDIT 2From @ AlexL 's answer , it 's starting to work . Just a couple of tweaking , but it looks very promising alreadyEDIT 3Thanks to Alex awesome work , his answer helped me merge this into my Open Source lib . I now have 2 live demos with Parent/Child ref ( flat dataset ) and with a Hierarchical Dataset ( tree dataset ) . I wish I could upvote more than once : )"

"Just saw some interesting code while doing a typo in coffee-script . I got the following codeNow I 've read alot about the module pattern in javascript and why its a bad thing ( takes more memory , longer to create ... ) but of course the upside is having truly private functions/variables . Would n't the above code be a good way to create private functions ( this would n't work for variables , unless you wanted static private variables ) as the function is only created once in the closure ? One of the upsides of the module pattern is also the execution speed of functions as the code does n't have to look up the prototype chain .

"V8 is capable of wrangling a lot of memory with use of -- max-old-space-size . I regularly use node for tasks which require 10GB+ , it 's great - memory is cheap and it 's much faster than reading/writing from/to disk.Where I run into trouble , however , is when trying to create very large individual arrays/maps/objects . I end up with error messages like this : And this : In both cases , it 's not that my computer ca n't handle it , or that I 've ran out of memory - it 's because there are some insidious artificial limits hiding in V8.To get the range error , throw this in your terminal : node -e `` new Array ( 5*1000*1000*1000 ) '' And to get the invalid table size error : node -e `` ( new Array ( 200*1000*1000 ) ) .fill ( 1 ) '' These artificial limits are well known ( 1 , 2 ) , and are apparently due to some old garbage collector code that the V8 team is scared of touching knows will take a lot of work to fix ( see chromium bug report ) .Question : To someone who knows the V8 and nodejs roadmaps well : Will these limits ever be lifted ?

"I have some code that exercises the “ invalid values ” setting on an element range index .

This setting means if I try to set the value of an onDate element and it is not castable to a dateTime or is null ( literal null in JSON or xsi : nil= '' true '' in XML ) , my update will fail . ( The opposite behavior is to completely ignore invalid values . ) I tried the following code in Server-Side JavaScript in MarkLogic 8.0-4 : I would have expected my request to succeed and to end up with 1 === errors.length , because only the second insert would have failed because 'asdf ' is not castable as a dateTime and it is not null .

"So I 'm running into a bit of a problem.I 've been trying to find a way to make the width of an input element fit the content . I kept making progress but then for whatever reason that method did n't work . So now I 'm on here looking for help . I 'll share the methods that I 've attempted that did n't end up working for me.note : For all of these attempts , I use ctx.measureText ( text ) which helps by getting the width of the textanother note : It might not be possible to fix , and if it 's not that 's okay , but for all of these methods , the width does n't update until the end if you hold down a key and it repeatsMethod 1 : keyup eventSo far , this is the best method in my opinion . It works pretty well , however , since it fires on the keyup event , it does n't change the width until after the character has been typed , which creates a jittery effect.Method 2 : keyup event plus paddingThis method is the same as the previous one , but I 've adding a padding of the width of the character ' W ' ( because it 's the widest letter in almost every font ) . This removes the jittery effect , but then there is an unnecessary amount of space left when you 're done.I tried doing this in addition to changing it to the proper width on the blur event , but this caused a major ( unrelated ) bug in my program.You could also use the change event , but if somebody presses a key that does n't type out a character , such as Alt , it adds the padding , then since there was n't a change the padding stays ( You could disable the event listener while the element is focused but that is very inefficient and annoying ) .You could also only add to the padding only if a character has been added , but the only two ways I can think of to do that are , again , very inefficient and annoying . ( either keeping a variable for the last length of the input and seeing if it changed , or using String.fromCharCode ( event.keyCode ) is greater than 0 ) Method 3 : keydown with paddingThis is slightly better than the method before , but the same problems apply.Also , using keypress gives you the same result as keydown . I could provide every example that I 've tried , but they 're mostly slightly different variations of everything above , so I 'll let you guys be creative and try to think of a solution.I 'm open to using jQuery if that 's the only way , but I would prefer otherwise.Thank you !"
"I have a very specific question and I am not sure you can do what I want with css .

But here is the thing , and I know I am being picky so I am not sure if css can do this . The problem I have is that the text just after the `` clickable '' jumps to the next line . I want it to not do that as it disrupts the reading . I know this is happening because the div in which I have my video is a block element .

"I have an html select : Using jQuery , is there an event I can capture for when the select option list has been revealed ?

It even works for the case where they type an alphabet letter ( it populates the list then jumps to the first option starting with that letter ) . But as I said , this is somewhat of an abomination . It 's also a little hacky just checking for `` tab '' as an exception -- there are definitely other exceptions that wo n't cause the select to be revealed.Is there a simple event that covers this use case ( or at least something less abominable that covers it ) ?

"Logic : I have a dialog for converting units . It has two stages of choice for the user : units to convert from and units to convert to . I keep this stage as a state , dialogStage , for maintainability as I 'm likely going to need to reference what stage the dialog is in for more features in the future . Right now it 's being used to determine what action to take based on what unit is clicked.I also have a state , dialogUnits , that causes the component to rerender when it 's updated . It 's an array of JSX elements and it 's updated via either foundUnitsArray or convertToUnitsArray , depending on what stage the dialog is at . Currently both states , dialogStage and dialogUnits , are updated at the same moment the problem occurs.Problem : When choosing the convertTo units , displayConversionTo ( ) was still being called , as though dialogStage was still set to 'initial ' rather than 'concertTo ' . Some debugging led to confusion as to why the if ( dialogStage == 'initial ' ) was true when I 'd set the state to 'convertTo'.I believe that my problem was that the dialogStage state was n't updated in time when handleUnitClick ( ) was called as it 's asynchronous . So I set up a new useEffect that 's only called when dialogStage is updated.The problem now is that the dialog shows no 'convertTo ' units after the initial selection . I believe it 's now because dialogUnits has n't updated in time ? I 've swapped my original problem from one state not being ready to another state not being ready.QuestionHow do I wait until both states are updated before continuing to call a function here ( e.g . handleUnitClick ( ) ? ) .Or have I mistaken what the problem is ? I 'm new to react and , so far , I 'm only familiar with the practice of state updates automatically rerendering a component when ready , unless overridden . Updating dialogUnits was displaying new units in the dialog until I tried to update it only when dialogStage was ready . It feels like an either/or situation right now ( in terms of waiting for states to be updated ) and it 's quite possible I 've overlooked something more obvious , as it does n't seem to fit to be listening for state updates when so much of ReactJs is built around that already being catered for with rerenders , etc.Component code :"

This data is sent to FFmpeg via binary web socket.For some reason , the stream seems to be randomly switching to a lower resolution mid-stream .

"WooCommerce-tables comes with classes like these , out of the box : shop_table shop_table_responsive cart woocommerce-cart-form__contents .

My entire site it encapsulated by a Vue-div , like so : So initially I wrote this code , to add the table-class to all tables : ... Putting that in the mounted ( ) { ... } -section . That worked ! So far so good . But WooCommerce is using jQuery quite a lot . And on the cart page , if I change the quantity ( and press 'Update ' ) , then the table-contents are updated using AJAX . If you 're curious how it works , then you can check it out here.And when that runs , I assume that WooCommerce grabs the initial cart-template and reloads that whole table ; without the newly added table-class . Bah humbug ! So how can I solve this ? I can override the WooCommerce ./cart/cart.php-template and add the class to the template . Seems like quite the overkill for adding a class . I can scan the DOM for tables every second ( or so ) and apply the table class , if it 's not there . Not cool ... Regardless if it 's done using jQuery or Vue.Since the whole table is being replaced in the DOM , then it does n't work to monitor the current table ( using watch ( ) { ... } in Vue ) and apply the class if it changes , - since it never changes ( it 's replaced ) .

"I have a ( GIS ) project which displays large amounts of customer data ( Thousands of records ) to clients . Where nescessary/possible/required , we use server side pagination/filtering/data manipulation but there are cases where it is most efficient to send the data in JSON format to the client and let their browser do the filtering.The amount of data is large , so we format it to save on bandwidth and parsing time - instead of individual objects , we send a structure that includes the attribute names first and then the values in a single flat array . On the client , we rebuild this into more traditional json objects before other processing occurs . eg : The code for doing this looks a little like this : Given that the attributes may change depending on the customer data , is there a way to do this translation that takes advantage of hidden classes in modern javascript engines like V8 ? I have done some micro benchmarks similar to our use case ( http : //jsfiddle.net/N6CrK/1/ ) where working with json such that hidden classes are used is orders of magnitude faster than building the objects as above .

See belowless clear in body that vars are localconfusing to see arguments that do n't do anythingif someone unknowingly removes them , your code writes to globalsStill it might be an easy way for a minifier to automatically squeeze out more bits.Update : a big disadvantage not mentioned so far : If a function is called with N parameters , the first N items in arguments will be binded to the first N identifiers in the argument list ( see the last bullet in 10.1.8 ) .

"10 years ago I wrote a GUI layout engine in C++ and I 'm curious how its functionality could be best approximated in the browser . 1 . C++In older GUI libraries ( like Microsoft Windows ' ) , the position and size of widgets is usually given by four numbers : left , top , width and height . My engine is different in that each of these numbers is doubled , so you have to specify eight numbers : relative left , absolute left ; relative top , absolute top ; relative width , absolute width ; relative height and absolute height . The relative values should be given in percents of the width or height of the parent widget , and the absolute values should be given in pixels . In case of top-level windows , the `` parent widget '' is the desktop . Examples : a ) 400 x 300 px window , centered on screen : b ) 150 px wide button container panel at the right edge of the main window : c ) Three buttons ( New , Open , Save ) at the top of the container panel , and one button ( Exit ) at the bottom : Writing such layout code by hand may feel awkward when you ’ re new to it , but it ’ s easy once you get the hang of it.2 . HTML , CSS , JavaScriptHere is what I was able to hack together thus far : a ) The hierarchy of the main window , the button panel , and the buttons , is given in HTML : b ) The divs ' position is set to absolute in CSS : c ) The layout functionality is implemented in JavaScript , using jQuery : Note that the JavaScript code is very similar to the C++ code shown above !

Since I 'm basically a desktop app developer , I need expert web developer opinion . Thanks ! === UPDATE ===Here is a pure HTML+CSS solution . I used the negative margin trick suggested by @ Christoph . My only problem is that the same constants are copied to lots of places in the CSS .

So finding a method to correctly ( more so than my current method ) calculate the value for U is what I 'm attempting to do.SolutionThe solution I went with ( based on marked solution ) : Minor Changes madeUsing the rule of three as a start , multiplied by 10 just to increase the values & create a wider range without needing to factor for float values too much.Also multiplied by -1 , this was so that completed tasks then give a negative number , while incomplete tasks show a higher number ( makes sense : higher urgency of a task therefore a higher number ) I may in future add to this , adding a velocity for a task as suggested & also taking into account for the number of people assigned to a given task.This function is only going to be used for a rough guide to show someone what tasks ( in a given list ) the might need to do first.Also as I used this in MySQL the function needed to be wrapped in a IFNULL ( due to existing data in my case ) An initial arbitrary value of -200 if it was null value ( as some tasks do not have an start/end date ) Thanks for the assistance & suggestions"

"We were using Redis for a plenty of time until we have come to the conclusion that moving to KeyDB may be a good choice for its features . EnvironmentBackgroundReferring to the KeyDB documentation , KeyDB is compatible with the latest version of Redis . KeyDB remains fully compatible with Redis modules API and protocol . As such a migration from Redis to KeyDB is very simple and would be similar to what you would expect migrating in a Redis to Redis scenario . https : //docs.keydb.dev/docs/migration/In the same page they provide a list of redis clients which are compatible with KeyDB .

Well that is not the case ! At least not for me ! I spent my last 3 days searching on the internet for the solution . I came to the conclusion that I should write to stackoverflow : ) The issue is somehow interesting .

I searched nearly all the internet for this error but no one provides a solution nor an explanation for what is going wrong.Luckily the process `` sometimes '' shows a stack for the error . It points to lib/redis/index.ts:711 inside the ioredis codes .

"I was reading about how the Javascript prototype property works along with inheritance and then began to look through the Angular.js code and came up with some questions.First off , I read that the prototype property points to an object that has a `` constructor '' property which points back to the original function that is used to create the object . So for example : The prototype also contains any other methods or properties that have been defined on it by us or by the Javascript language itself , and these are shared by all instances of the object . If you want an object called Square to inherit from Shape you need to set Square 's prototype equal to a new instance of Shape because the internal [ [ prototype ] ] property of Square.prototype gets set to the public object value of the Shape.prototype property.This all makes sense to me.However , the Angular.js code that I have a question about seems to be related to all of this but does something that I do not understand . It does n't appear to be dealing with inheritance so I can understand why there would be differences , but I 'm just curious why they wrote it the way they did.Within Angular.js , there is a HashMap object and a Lexer object , but they are defined differently yet appear to be instantiated and used in the same exact way . The Lexer constructor is first defined , and then they set the prototype to an object literal containing methods that should be shared by all instances of the Lexer . This all makes sense . What I do n't understand is why they specify the `` constructor '' property and set it to just `` Lexer '' when they do n't for HashMap below.Then if you look at the HashMap code , they do the same thing except that they do not specify the constructor property . Why is this ? It appears to work exactly the same , and I 've tested that the constructor still gets called.So is the constructor property optional when there is no inheritance , so maybe one person wrote the Lexer and another the HashMap and one decided to specify the constructor ?"

"Solved , see bottom of post for final algorithmBackground : I am working on a 2D platformer using JS and the HTML canvas element . The level map is tile-based , but the player is not clamped to the tiles . I am using a collision detection algorithm outlined in `` Tiny Platformer '' on Code inComplete . It largely works except for one edge case ( or `` ledge '' case ) .The problem : The player is falling down and also moving right , into the wall . As it falls , it teleports up to the height of the ledge . Instead the player should fall normally without teleporting.Is there any way to change the algorithm to prevent this behavior ? If not , can you suggest an alternate collision detection algorithm ? Ideally any fix would not assume the player always falls down , because in the game the player 's fall direction switches between up/down/left/right.The algorithm : The player 's new position is calculated assuming no collisions . ( Not shown in the code below ) A function called getBorderTiles takes an object ( the player ) and returns the tiles touching each of the player 's 4 corners . Since the player is not bigger than a tile , those border tiles are necessarily the only tiles the player is touching . Note that some of these tiles may be the same . For example if the player is only occupying one column , the left-top/right-top tiles will be the same , as will the left-bottom/right-bottom tiles . If this happens , getBorderTiles still returns all four tiles , but some will be the same.It checks these border tiles in the level map ( a 2D array ) to see if they are solid . If a tile is solid , the object is colliding with that tile.It tests up/down/left/right collision . If the player is moving down and colliding with a down tile but not colliding with the corresponding up tile , the player is colliding down . If the player is moving left and colliding with a left tile but not colliding with the corresponding right tile , it 's colliding left . Etc . Up/down checks are performed before left/right checks . The variables that store the border tiles are adjusted if there is an up/down collision before performing the left/right check . For example if the player collides down , it will be pushed into the up tiles , so the BL/BR tiles are now the same as the TL/TR tiles.The player 's x , y , and speed are adjusted based on the directions it 's colliding in.Why the algorithm fails : The bottom right tile is solid but the top right is n't , so ( step 4 ) the player collides down and ( step 5 ) it 's pushed up . Also , it collides with the BR tile but not BL , so it collides right and is pushed left . By the end , the player is rendered just above and to the left of the ledge . In effect it 's teleported up.Attempt at solution : I tried to fix this , but it only created another issue . I added a check so that the player only collides with a tile if it 's some distance within that tile ( say 3px ) . If the player was only barely in the BR tile , the algorithm would not register a down collision , so the player would not teleport up . However , if the player fell down onto ground in another scenario , it did n't acknowledge the collision until the player got pretty far into the ground . The player jittered when it fell a bit into the ground , got pushed back to the top of the ground , fell again , etc.Thanks for reading this far . I really appreciate your feedback.Current algorithm code : UPDATE : Solved with maraca 's solution . The algorithm is below . Basically it tests ( x then y ) and resolved collisions , and then it tests ( y then x ) and resolves collisions that way . Whichever test results in the player moving a shorter distance is the one that ends up being used.Interestingly it requires a special case for when the player is colliding in both the top and left direction . Perhaps this relates to the fact that the player 's ( x , y ) coordinate is on its top left corner . In this case , the test that results in the player moving a LONGER distance should be used . It is clear in this gif : The player is the black box and the yellow box represents where the player would be if it had used the other test ( the test that resulted in the player moving a longer distance ) . Ideally the player should n't move into the wall , and instead it should be where the yellow box is . Thus in this scenario the longer-distance test should be used.Here 's the quick and dirty implementation . It is not at all optimized but hopefully it shows the algorithm 's steps pretty clearly ."

"On a recent project I used Alexander Farkas ' HTML5 Shiv and I noticed that when minified the script was 2.274 KB .

I dug into the html5shiv source . It was 248 sloc , which seemed like a lot of unnecessary code for such a simple task .

I am wondering if there are any substantial differences in these two methods : Method 1Method 2I have seen these two methods used for creating a complex JavsScript object . I have even seen large JS plugins like jQuery use method 2 instead of method 1 to set up their jQuery functions . Is one of these faster or more efficient than the other in any way ?"

Neither dataPromise nor errorPromise gets resolved or rejected.How can I signal the end of my audio , close the SR stream and still get the pending SR results ? I need to stick with streamingRecognize API because the audio I 'm streaming is real-time , even though it may stop suddenly.To clarify , it works as long as I keep streaming the audio , I do receive the real-time SR results . However , when I send the final audio chunk and end the stream like above , I do n't get the final results I 'd expect otherwise.To get the final results , I actually have to keep streaming silence for several more seconds , which may increase the ST bill . I feel like there must be a better way to get them.Updated : so it appears , the only proper time to end a streamingRecognize stream is upon data event where StreamingRecognitionResult.is_final is true . As well , it appears we 're expected to keep streaming audio until data event is fired , to get any result at all , final or interim.This looks like a bug to me , filing an issue.Updated : it now seems to have been confirmed as a bug .

A red box , a green box , a blue box , a yellow box and a black box.Each box can contain one box , that can also contain a box , and so on.What I receive is this kind of object : So this example is : a black box , containing a red box , containing an empty green box . ( black - > red - > green - > empty ) There are conditions : The black box can only contain blue , green and red , The red box can only contain green and yellow , The yellow box can contain nothing , The other boxes ( green & blue ) can contain anythingWhat I need to do is some kind of `` box set editor '' , I receive a box object , that is complex or not ( meaning that it can have only one box level , or several ) . I have to represent it in a list of select boxes , so , for the example I wrote it will show this : This has to be achieved with AngularJS . The whole example is coming on a table , so the boxes are displayed as a table this way : Notice the ng-click part . The setCurrentBox ( ) function is defined in the controller , and it sets , as $ scope.currentBox , the box object received from the `` BoxService '' .Click on the row will call the BoxService , retrieve the json object for the selected box ( completely ! with the contained boxes into it , as written at top of the thread ) , and assign it to the $ scope.currentBox variable.Change a box selection value should `` empty '' the next possible choice ( set `` none '' as selected and add the possible choices as options ) and , if there are child boxes then just erase them ( change black choice to red in my example black- > red- > green- > empty would give red- > empty ( None -selected- and green and yellow options ) .In my case , I only have direct access to $ scope.currentBox . And the boxes that `` currentBox '' contains are properties . So , somehow I think I should do some kind of if object.box ! =null then read box ... But I 'm a bit lost about it ... Well , I do n't know if I 'm clear enough in my problem definition , here is a short fiddle that should `` show where I want to get '' in this kind of `` Russian Dolls '' problematic ... http : //jsfiddle.net/z267dquk/2/Update 1 : http : //jsfiddle.net/0js7q638/thanks for reading / help Update 2 : Here is an example of what I exactly mean as my question/What I 'd like to make/What I miss does not seem to be clear.Concrete example - START SITUATION : Box object : When user selects box 0 in the table he gets this object : This object has to be displayed into editable select boxes as follows : CONCRETE EXAMPLE : USER ACTION 1 : If user sets box 2 as NO CHOICE OR YELLOW ( since yellow box can not contain any box ) , then the current box object should look like this : And the HTML part should turn like this : CONCRETE EXAMPLE : USER ACTION 1 : If user sets box 1 as BLUE , then the current box object should look like this : And the HTML part should turn like this : Note that I can get the possible choices for a box , or all possible choices for any box from the BoxService . This HAS TO come from BoxService . This data can be huge , it is small in this example , but this can be a long list of objects that can be contained in another one.Hope this example can make my question more clear.Thanks for reading"

"This script when included in an HTML document which includes any declared styles ( excluding those set by style= '' '' ) will output an optimized stylesheet to the to the page . The script uses the following methods ... Ignore any @ or : rules to leave responsive styles as is.Separate the rules into single selector rules so we can test for inheritance later on.Remove rules that apply to selectors which do n't exist in the document , thanks to @ RickHitchcock for this.Retrieve both the declared and computed styles in the same format ( excluding percentages ) then compare both values each other , then remove the property and check again.if the declared value matches the computed value and by removing the property the value changes , then set the keep flag . This tells us whether the property has an effect on an element , if no elements were affected by the property ... remove it.If there are no properties in the remaining CSSRule then remove that rule.As a side effect most selectors which do n't change the browsers default setting will be removed ( unless using font as opposed to font-* and similar which will activate the rest of the settings for that property ) .While running this script on a site which includes styles relating to dynamic elements , I just wrap them in a media queryQuestionHow can I group the selectors with common properties ?

The problem : I have a jQuery heavy page that has a built in admin interface . The admin functions only trigger when an admin variable is set . These functions require a second library to work properly and the second file is only included if the user is an admin when the page is first created . The functions will never trigger for normal users and normal users do not get the include for the second library.Is it bad to reference a function does not exist in the files currently included even if that function can never be called ? ( does that make sense : ) Pseudocode : header : ( notice that admin.js is not included ) script.js : ( admin functions referenced but ca n't be executed ) Ideas : I suppose two separate files for users and admins could be used but I feel that would be an overly complicated solution ( do n't want to maintain two large files with only a few lines of difference ) . The only reason I include a reference to the admin function in this file is I need to attach it to page elements that get refreshed as a part of the script . When jQuery refreshes the page I need to reattach function to interactive elements.The Question : I want to keep things very simple and not have to include file I do n't have to if they will not be used by the user . Is this a good way to do this or should I be going another route ?

"From React DOCS : https : //reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.htmlState Updates May Be AsynchronousReact may batch multiple setState ( ) calls into a single update for performance.This makes total sense . If you have something like the function below , it would be very inefficient to re-render on every setState callSo , in the situation above , I expect React to batch all 3 setState calls into a single re-render . And it does exactly that ! But what I want to know is : Once handleClick has completed , is a re-render guaranteed to happen immediatelly handleClick has done running ? I mean literally immediately , like synchronously immediately ? From this snippet that I 've build , it seems that this is true . React will synchronously apply the updates ( re-render ) after handleClick has completed . Correct me if I 'm wrong in assuming that.See snippet below : Click 3 times as fast as you canhandleClick will call a setState and will log the current props.counterThere is an expensive loop on App , so it will take a long time to re-renderYou 'll be able to click much faster than React can re-render the whole AppBut you 'll see the props.counter is different every time , without any repetition , even if you click multiple times really fastIt means that once your 2nd click is processed ( it will take a while because of the expensive loop ) , React has already re-rendered the whole thing and the handleClick function has already been recreated with the new value for props.counter that came from the counter updated state.Try clicking 5 times really fast and you 'll see that the behavior is the same.QUESTIONWhen setState calls are made inside an event handler function , once that handler function has completed running , is it guaranteed that a re-render will occur immediately ( synchronously ) after that completion of the handler ?"

"I spent some time debugging a strange infinite loop problem in a NodeJS testsuite . It only happens under rare conditions but I can reproduce it when I attach to the chrome debugger.I think it has to do with V8 's handling of stack traces in exceptions and a extension that the vows library did to the AssertionError object ( vows added an toString method ) . I could also be mistaken , so I wanted to ask whether my understanding of V8 's implementation is correct.Here is a minimal example to reproduce the error : Now the program ends up in an infinite loop : the toString method ( added by the vows library ) is called again and again when this.stack is accessed in the regexp on line 83.When I inspect this in the debugger , it shows that it is an AssertionError but its stack property is undefined . However , when I hover with the mouse over it , it shows the actual stack trace.I assume this phenomena is caused by the laziness optimization of V8 . It only computes the stack trace on demand . In doing so , it interferes with the added toString method of vows . The toString method again accesses the stack trace ( this.stack ) , so the loop continues.Is that conclusion correct ? If so , is there a way to patch the vows code , so it works with V8 ( or can I at least report it as a bug in the vows project ) ? I 'm using node v0.10.28 under Ubuntu.Update : Simplified example without vowsHere is a simplified version . It no longer depends on vows , but instead I have only copied the relevant parts of its toString extension : In debug mode , the recursion takes place in the if statement.Update : Even simplier version with ReferenceError ( I also create a jsfiddle example , but I can not reproduce the infinite loop there , only with node . )"

"I 'm developing a Javascript based multiplayer game.So far I have the basic server , client and networking ready.I did have an issue where my player was moving faster on a 120Hz screen as opposed to a 60Hz screen . I 've fixed this by multiplying the player 's movementspeed by the deltatime of the 'requestAnimationFrame'.However ; would it be a better solution to separate the animations from the logic ? As in : While the difference may be `` neglectable '' I want to avoid players with 240Hz 'spamming ' the server and have an advantage over other players.Though on the other hand for a 240Hz monitor ; only 1 in 4 frames your keyboard input will be handled , so it may not feel as smooth ?

Here is one of the questions in JavaScript online-test before job interview : Q : How to make comparison a == b to be true ? ( e.g . console.log ( a == b ) // true ) I answered that it 's impossible because a and b are two different instances of F and equal comparison in JS in case of non-primitives compares reference.But some time ago I 've read article `` Fake operator overloading in JavaScript '' by Axel Rauschmayer : http : //www.2ality.com/2011/12/fake-operator-overloading.html — and I wonder if there is a hack to fake operator overload in comparison of objects ?

I prototyped Function so that it has a getBody function : See here for more info.I tried to test it this way : but received an error : TypeError : console.log.getBody is undefined.I figured out that maybe this happens because console.log was defined before I actually prototyped Function so I created an empty function x right before the prototyping and tried to call which worked without a problem . Checking the type of console.log with typeof console.log results in `` function '' . Here 's a CodePen to try it out .

"Taking the jQuery framework for example , if you run code like this : The stack trace you get in Firebug will look like this : As you can see , it 's not very readable , because you have to click on each function to find out what it is . The anonymous functions would also show up as ( ? ) ( ) in the profiler , and they can lead to the `` can not access optimized closure '' bug . It seems to me that these are good reasons to avoid them . Then there 's the fact that ECMAScript 5 will deprecate arguments.callee in its strict mode , which means it wo n't be possible to reference anonymous functions with it , making them a little less future-proof.On the other hand , using named functions can lead to repetition , e.g . : Am I correct in thinking that this repetition is justified in light of the debugging convenience named functions provide , and that the prevalence of anonymous functions in good frameworks like jQuery is an oversight ?"

In particular I want to compile the first directive ( topic ) and then inject it in the other one ( about-us ) so I can access the DOM elements in the about-us link function.Here is the code for what I want to achieve : Both about-us and topic directives use transclude : true inside their configurations to compile their respective templates.For the sake of completeness here is the code for the two templates : The problem is that the $ timeout function called as a work around has a completely random behaviour and sometimes it works , other times it does n't . How can I fix this ? Am I missing something about transclude , link and compile functions ? Thank you for every reply !"

"Because jQuery is a widely used and mature collaborative effort , I ca n't help but to look at its source for guidance in writing better Javascript . I use the jQuery library all the time along with my PHP applications , but when I look under the hood of this rather sophisticated library I realize just how much I still do n't understand about Javascript . Lo , I have a few questions for the SO community . First of all , consider the following code ... vsNow , is this to say that the attr ( ) method was designed to accept EITHER an attribute name , an attribute name and a value , or a pair-value map ? Can someone give me a short explanation of what a map actually is and the important ways that it differs from an array in Javascript ? Moving on , the whole library is wrapped in this business ... I get that the wrapped parentheses cause a behavior similar to body onLoad= '' function ( ) ; '' , but what is this practice called and is it any different than using the onLoad event handler ? Also , I ca n't make heads or tails of the ( window ) bit there at the end . What exactly is happening with the window object here ? Am I wrong in the assessment that objects are no different than functions in Javascript ? Please correct me if I 'm wrong on this but $ ( ) is the all encompassing jQuery object , but it looks just like a method . Here 's another quick question with a code example ... ... Should look something like this on the inside ( maybe I 'm wrong about this ) ... Is this the standing procedure for defining objects and their child methods and properties in Javascript ? Comparing Javascript to PHP , do you use a period . the same way you would use - > to retrieve a method from an object ? I apologize for this being a bit lengthy , but answers to these questions will reveal a great deal to me about jQuery and Javascript in general . Thanks !"

"I have a coordinate system which basically represents a screen.And I have an arbitrary amount of positions . E.g . : I 'm looking for an algorithm that finds the most unpopulated point . The white mini circles represent the population and the red Xs mark points that appear very unpopulated to me : My goal is run an animation that randomly moves all these white mini circles into random directions and as soon as a circle has left the screen it should get teleported to the most unpopulated spot so that the amount of big empty spaces gets reduced.I have tried to achieve that by calculating the sum of distances from every integer coordinate to every circle and then choosing the coordinate that has the highest distance sum . That alone seems to be pretty CPU intensive already , but I noticed that this algorithm causes the circles to teleport to the borders of my coordinate system . So I also added the sums of the distances from each integer coordinate to every border integer coordinate . At that point , the script essentially freezes . So this is definitely not the right approach.I 'm running out of ideas . I guess I do n't need a perfect algorithm , but rather one with a healthy balance between precision and performance . In the end I want to be able to run that algorithm multiple times per second on 1920x1080 canvas with around 80 of these minicircles .

"The situationI have a React/Redux app that displays markers on a map , and groups them into clusters based on their proximity given the current zoom level ( similar to this example - my app differs from this example slightly in that the clusters on the map will display specific data from their child markers , and not simply a total number of child markers ) .I anticipate having new markers added frequently , and the app will update to show the new markers in real-time.The React component structure looks something like this : So the map re-renders the appropriate clusters every time a ) new markers are added to the map , and b ) the map 's zoom level changes.I 'm trying to determine the best way to organize this data in a Redux state tree.Option 1 : Simple approachOne option would be to keep the state tree very simple , and let the UI handle all of the clustering logic as needed : If I organize state in this way , the UI will have to go through every marker and recalculate the visible clusters every time the zoom level changes . With a high number of markers , that could turn out to be a lot of recalculations , and I anticipate that users will be doing a lot of zooming in and out while using this app.Option 2 : Store cluster groups for each zoom levelAnother option would be to keep the cluster organization in the state tree for each zoom level ( e.g . 1 through 19 ) : In this case , the cluster calculations would only happen when new markers are added to the map , and would only be run on the new markers , not on the entire set . Zooming in or out would not require recalculating , as the cluster organization would already be stored in the state.The questionSo , which option makes more sense ? On the one hand , I am compelled to keep it simple and avoid premature optimization ( i.e . go with Option 1 ) .On the other hand , I can see that Option 1 could easily result in tons of recalculations happening very frequently . And Option 2 provides a state tree that translates more directly into my React component structure.Which option would you suggest , and why ? Are their other approaches I 'm not considering that may work better ?"
"I do n't see anything in the JavaScript spec , the proposed DOM spec extensions related to SharedArrayBuffer , or the current WHAT-WG HTML spec to suggest that shared memory will be synchronized/updated across threads when one thread posts a message to another and the other processes the message . ( After the one has already sent the shared memory to the other . ) However , I 'm also unable to verify experimentally that it does n't happen ( in my tests , I do n't see stale values ) . Is there some such guarantee that I 'm missing , and if so , where is it guaranteed ? For instance , is it documented for postMessage and I 've missed it , or is there something about yielding back to the event loop / job queue that guarantees it ( since handling a message from another thread involves doing that ) , etc. ? Or alternately , is it definitely not guaranteed ( and that information is in a spec somewhere ) ? Please do n't speculate or make a `` reasonable guess .

"( I 'm sorry if my question title is n't very good , I could n't think of a better one . Feel free to suggest better options . ) I 'm trying to create a reusable `` property grid '' in Angular , where one can bind an object to the grid , but in such a way that presentation of the object can be customized somewhat.This is what the directive template looks like ( the form-element is n't important to my question , so I 'll leave it out ) : and , the directive code : Here 's an example usage : And the getSitePropertyData ( ) function that goes with it : The reason I 'm going through such a `` property data '' function and not just binding directly to properties on the object is that I need to control the order of the properties , as well as whether they should even be shown to the user at all , and also what kind of property it is ( text , email , number , date , etc . ) for the sake of presentation.At first , as you can tell from the value property remnant in the getSitePropertyData ( ) function , I first tried providing the values directly from this function , but that would n't bind to the object , so changes either in the object or form the property grid did n't sync back and forth . Next up , then , was using the key idea , which lets me do this : propertyObject [ prop.key ] —which works great for direct properties , but as you can see , I had to comment out the `` Company '' field , because it 's a property of a property , and propertyObject [ `` a.b '' ] does n't work.I 'm struggling to figure out what to do here . I need the bindings to work , and I need to be able to use arbitrarily deep properties in my bindings . I know this kind of thing is theoretically possible ; I 've seen it done for instance in UI Grid , but such projects have so much code that I would probably spend days finding out how they do it.Am I getting close , or am I going about this all wrong ?"

"I just do n't know what to think anymore . It seems like the people who made javascript went out of their way to allow it to be written a million different ways so hackers can have a field day.I finally got my white list up by using html agility pack . It should remove As it is not in my white list plus any onclick , onmouse and etc.However now it seems you can write javascript in the attribute tags.and since I allow SRC attributes my white list ca n't help me on this . So I came up with the idea to go through all valid attributes at the end and look inside them.So it would find all my allowed attributes for every html tag ( so src , href and etc ) .I then found the innertext and put it to lowercase . I then did a index check on this string for `` javascript '' .If an index was found I started at that index and removed every character from that index on . So in the above case the attribute would be left with Src= '' '' .Now it seems that is not good enough since you can do something likejava script jav ascriptand probably a space between every letter.So I do n't know how to stop it . If it was just a space between java and script then I could just write a simple regex that did not care how many spaces between . But if it is really that you can put a space or tab or whatever after each letter then I have no clue.Then to top it off you can do all these other great ways toohttp : //ha.ckers.org/xss.htmlI know this is for some cross scripting attack ( I am not making an XSS asp.net mvc does a good job of this already ) but I do n't see why it ca n't be use for other things like like in all those examples it makes alerts so it could be used for something else.So I have no clue how to check and remove any of these.I am using C # but I do n't know how to stop any of these and do n't know of anything in C # that could help me out ."

"I try to use the raster reprojection of a map following this example . If I change the example kavrayskiy7 projection by the Azimuthal Equidistant projection , it should project the Earth onto a disc ( the image of the projection map ) . However , the raster reprojection goes beyond that disc and fills the entire canvas with an extended picture ( the inverse projection function is not injective , several x/y points on the map correspond to a single lon/lat coordinates ) . In the original example , this should be avoided with the line but for this example that does not work . I found other glitches for instance when using the Mollweide projection ( two lines appear at the poles ) due to the same efect.To solve this , one way would be to fix the inverse projections so they return error or None when the x/y input is out of range . My attempt was to check if a point is on range using the forward projection of the whole sphere to obtain a SVG path with the boundary of the map , as given by this code : ( see for instance this example ) . However , I found no easy method to check whether a point [ x , y ] is inside a SVG closed path.So my questions are : Is there a bug on the inverse projections , or am I not using them correctly ? How could I find if a [ x , y ] point is inside the svg path , assuming that this is the best approach ? By curiosity , where is the algorithm code of the d3 path function to obtain the boundary profile of the map ? I could not find it on the github repo .

My components that use d3 generally have the following in the top few lines : ... and I assume I 'd have to no longer import d3 in this manner , but I 'm not sure if simply changing all of the imports will change the bundle as well , or if I have to do something else to remove the modules that are n't used.2 : Is there a smaller pdf-generation library to use , rather than kendo-react-pdf ? And likewise is there something smaller than react-datepicker ? I only have a single datepicker in my app , and the entire react-datepicker library seems like overkill ? 3 : Lastly , what is a size for a bundle that i should strive for ? The screenshot of the bundle show the stat size , parsed size , and gzipped size for most of the app ( excluding just the blue chunks which is the code ive written in /src i think ? ) . Is this big ? Thanks in advance for your help with this ! !"

"I 'm new to Handlebars and using version 4.1.2 . I 'm trying to move some templates which were written in PHP to Handlebars.The source of my data is a JSON feed and the structure is like this : The output of my HTML template ( in the PHP version ) was as follows : EuropeGroup 1FF1AFF1BGroup 2FF2AAsiaGroup 999FF999AFF999BAmericasGroup 10000FF10000AThe way in which this was achieved - without duplicating any of the regulations_label or groups_label during output - was to use conditional logic which checked the previous array value to see if it had changed , e.g . The above code means that groups_label is only rendered if it is not the same as the previous value , i.e . it can only print `` Group 1 '' once , etc.So in Handlebars I 'm wanting to apply the same principle . I 've read Handlebars/Mustache - Is there a built in way to loop through the properties of an object ? and understand there is a { { @ index } } and { { @ key } } . The problem I 'm having is that I ca n't apply conditional logic on these . For example there is no such thing as { { @ index - 1 } } The way in which I have it set up is as follows : The content is rendered to the # output div , but it repeats each level , e.g.This problem is only happening because I 'm unable to find a way to see what the previous array value was and do conditional logic .

Someone commented that it 's possible to do this kind of thing in plain js/jquery .

"SOLVED ! ! ( look at my last edit ) I want to make an army fight of 20.000 vs 20.000 units on canvas . So , for every unit data is : And i would to see this fight in real time ( 25 frames per second ) .If i generate 1 frame with Json and save on file , it is 2.5mb size ( 40k such units with this data ) . 1 second ( 25 frames ) = 62.5 mb file size . And the fight could last about 30 minutes , so it should use 112gb . This is bad . If i would make the file as binary data , it should take 27 times less place , or 4gb for 30 mins . That 's still bad . 2 hrs movie takes 700mb.I need to save many fights on server . Real players should make their armies and fight each other , so i need the fights to be saved . Every fight is unique , because every damage of every unit is random 0~10 and after unit kills an enemy , it regenerates 1 health . I 'm doing calculations with PHP and saving files on server . All 40.000 units are on one screen , all can be visible at once , i want it like that . For now , units are single 2x2 pixel cubes , red and blue teams , its easy to load for javascript . But , to generate file with PHP i need about 1 hour . That 's another problem . Because for every frame i need to iterate these 40.000 units ( for updating x/y , searching for nearby enemies or friends , then for doing damage and returning target or killed enemy coordinates ) , then iterate over again to unset killed units , and before putting all that into file , i need to iterate over everything and remove unused data that was used for calculations . And to finish this 30 mins fight i need to repeat it 45000 times . Also , every minute there are less and less units . But my point is somehow to make all that file generating in less than a minute , just need a logical way , if some exist.Questions : 1 ) What is the best way to save my files on server and make the files much less on size ? ( so far is to use binary data and compress to zip ) 2 ) what is the fastest way to calculate my fights ? ( so far is to compile with C++ ) // Edited . Here is my whole game code , just like that : ) This is main action : This is unit : This is js : SOLVED ! Thx to my colleague in my work ! He gave me brilliant idea ! To get the result i needed i just need for every next battle to generate random number ( 0~10000 ) and place it into single MySQL database . In addition also put there formations , units , their starting strength , health and everything else . And all the calculations do with javascript : With one constant number ( given from backend ) i make a formula to always reproduce same army fight - > every unit will move forwards and they always stop at the same time anyways no matter what the calculation . The uniqueness is the random damage every unit gives and what process after . And all the damage will be just their `` x/y position somehow compared to constant number '' and do whatever to get single damage , random for every unit because they all are in different map positions , but damage will always be 0~10 . With the same constant number , all units will always do the same damage after calculation and always will move same at every replay , die and do same damage at every replay . All the hardest work will be on javascript - to make calculations using this constant number . My random number can be any .

"Having some trouble sorting through the correct approach to handling the load event in Chrome when loading HTML objects .

Unfortunately for my application this is a critical feature as I need to place the widget at specific screen locations using javascript . The fiddle below will put Chrome in an infinite loop while it only fires once in other browsers ( although in my app Chrome fires the load event twice then stops ) .HTMLJavaScript : Infinite loopI 'm assuming this is a Chrome bug , and although I can work around it by checking how many times the object has been loaded and exit the load event early , there is a performance penalty because it looks like the entire object is reloaded each time ( global JavaScript in the object is re-run ) and when loading a couple of widgets as objects the browser significantly slows down impacting the end user experience.No matter what I try I ca n't seem to avoid the multiple re-loads happening . Has anyone else seen this bug and knows how to avoid the re-loading ? On a related note , Chrome will render and display the object then move it to its correct position which flickers the screen , while other browsers will render the widget at its final location ( after the load javascript has been run ) which is a nicer experience and I ca n't find a way to stop Chrome rendering twice .

"I 'm reading the book Javascript : the Good Parts . I 'm a little confused when I read the code below : I think the first part of code above means that any function in JavaScript now has a method called method . But is `` Number '' also a function ? Why does Number.method make sense ? I suppose that Number inherits Number.prototype which inherits Object.prototype ( Number- > Number.prototype- > Object.prototype ) , since Number has no `` method '' method at the beginning , it will look for it along the prototype chain . But Function.prototype is n't on the chain , right ? What 's the relationship among Number , Number.prototype and Function.prototype ? UPDATE I : I 've searched for some extra information and am more confused now . Some say that Number is in fact a function and this seems to make sense because the value of Number instanceof Function is true.But the value of ( -10 / 3 ) instanceof Number is false . Is n't this confusing ? If a number in math ( such as 3 , 2.5 , ( -10 / 3 ) ) is not even a Number in JavaScript , how can ( -10 / 3 ) invoke integer ( ) which is a method from Number ? ( The line below comes from the same book ) UPDATE II : Problem solved , basically . Thanks to @ Xophmeister 's help , now my conclusion is that Number can invoke method because Number is a constructor so that it is linked to Function.prototype . As for why a number ( 3 , 2.5 , ( -10 / 3 ) ) whose type is primitive type in JavaScript can invoke a method that object Number has , one should refer to this page.I got this conclusion basically from @ Xophmeister 's help and a little search so it may not be precise enough .

"I know you are probably wondering self-made barchart ? Why not an existing library ? Well I hate to use files with 20000 lines of code while only 500 are necessary.Oh and it 's fun : ) The main objective is that I 'll be using this script for an app I 'll be making using Phonegap . So the lower the size , the better.So the idea is to achieve the following : I 've been able to to draw the bars , make sure they are of equal width and have their height dependent on the height of the parent container . As you 'll see in the code below I also added a font-size to the options . As some chart will expand around 300px of height ( which would be using the default 16px for example ) . And some only 50px with a font-size of 12 or less . So I reduced the bar ChartContainer by 3 x the fontsize ( + rest ) to make sure there is enough space for the top ( amounts ) & bottom ( legends + title ) Now I 'm not entirely sure how to add and center the amounts . I tried searching existing chart libraries to check on how it all has been rendered , unfortunately they all use canvasses or SVG containers . Any suggestions ?"

"I am starting a new project at work , and we have been tasked to create a Universal Header . This means on the different domains/servers we own , our customer-created sites , and third-party sites we will need a very simple way to give this code to people.This Universal Header will also contain some search functionality , which is slightly relevant to my question . Put simply , it will contain JavaScript to change the action attribute on its < form > element , depending on the dropdown selection , as well as submitting the form.The way we want the header to work , is that it lives in one location , we were thinking some kind of HTTP Request to get the header . This will maximize the portability of the Universal Header , in our opinion.The header will need to integrate nicely with WordPress ( not a problem ) , but also with AngularJS , in our discussions , it 's a little less certain whether that will be possible . Thus the `` slightly relevant '' piece of the search functionality.One of the solutions we talked about was doing it in HTML like this answer , but I 've always been a little more skittish about requesting raw HTML over HTTP , and just dumping it into a page , but maybe it 's the right way to go , but maybe not ? Since we were n't sure , we thought about the JIRA Issue Collector where they basically stream JavaScript to their customer that then builds the issue tracker button , fixed on the side of a page which has some HTML , CSS , and JS in it . The user can then click this button , which opens a form ready for submission . That may be an over simplification , but basically , their JS snippet packages HTML/CSS/JS and submits data to their server.This is the direction we would love to go with this : having a single file contain all we need . However , I am wondering a few things : What are some patterns to deal with the `` flash '' of the header ? Since it 's AJAXed in on page load , the header will be missing then suddenly be there , how could you deal with that usability problem ? I was thinking like a Skeleton area where the header would be , then have the JavaScript replace it , but I do n't know if that 's trite or not.What 's a standard way to bundle the creation of HTML , the CSS , and some JavaScript functionality all contained inside a single file ( like a JS file ) , or better to have an HTML file linking to a JS and Stylesheet ? I 'm just uncertain about the bundling piece . We wo n't be using Angular or React for this project , but I do have some familiarity with Webpack , which seems like it could do the job , maybe . Even though this project wo n't be using Angular or React , it will still need to integrate with other frameworks.One thing I 'm thinking about is possibly breaking the HTML into a separate HTTP Request , and having the JavaScript and Styles bundled in another HTTP Request -- almost like a web component . In other words , we could request the HTML , and the CSS/JS in parallel and when it returns , just smash it together in the UI . What are some dangers of doing that , or some things to think about when doing it like that ? What would be a good way to integrate this with AngularJS ? Since this header will have search functionality in it , we need some way of broadcasting ( to AngularJS ) when someone submits a search , and what that search is they 've submitted.Originally , for the last point above , I was thinking of attaching it to a window object . Then creating a custom event handler in JavaScript — but how do you do that ? Maybe the below pseudo code is way off base , but that 's why I 'm asking the question : If there are some better , cleaner ways , I 'd be glad to hear about it.I appreciate any help with this . This is new territory for us , and overall , we want to be able to have a highly maintainable header that can be easily shared with different domains , etc ."
"I 'm trying to render a d3js force simulation but I 'd like to ensure my nodes do n't relay false information.With the following code used to display the nodes but due to the dynamic nature of force layouts , it occasionally pushes some nodes out of its appropriate x-coordinate location.Here is an egregious example of this happening : The numbers should be in order from left to right.I made an attempt to use the fx property on a node to lock the position in place : This works as intended for preserving the x position but when the inOrder method is called , the nodes instantly jump to their final x position .

Quick version : My ultimate goal is to do something like the link below but with an async call to firebase per useEffect where the list data is composed of firebase object content.https : //codesandbox.io/s/usage-pxfy7ProblemIn the code below useEffect encapsulates code that pings firebase and gets some data back called `` clients '' . The data is retrieved perfectly . I then store that data using useState to two different instances of useState . The data is stored at clientList and clientListForRender.So far so good.Now the problem starts.I have a third instance of useState that takes a number . I want to set a keypress event to the document so that I can use the up/down arrows to toggle the counter and access each value of the clientListForRender array . When I set the eventListener I do not have access to the array ( presumably due to the async calls not being in an order that allows for it ) .I am not sure how to write my hooks in a way that gives me the result I want.Thank you .

"I have a Gatsby site that consumes a number of packages . One of those packages is published from our monorepo : @ example/forms . That package contains a number of named exports , one for each form component that we use on our site . There are quite a large number of forms and some are relatively complex multistep forms of a non-trivial size.Currently , Gatsby/Webpack does a good job of treeshaking , and does produce a large number of bundles , some common bundles and one for each page of the site , containing any local assets or components that are only used on that page . However , all the components from @ example/forms are being added to the commons bundle , despite the fact that most are used on only a single page . This is causing unnecessary bloat of the commons bundle which is loaded on every page . If feels like it should be possible for the individual components within @ example/forms to be split out into the page-specific bundles , but I 'm not sure if I 'm hoping for too much . For example , if Form A is only used on page 4 , I 'd like Form A to only be added to the bundle for page 4 . Is this something that is supported , and if so , what could be preventing this from happening . @ example/forms is transpiled with ES6 exports left intact , and sideEffects is set to false in its package.json . Its main file is index.js which ( re ) exports all the form components from their own files as separate named exports : Another thing that might be relevant is that all the exports from @ example/forms are used within the Gatsby site , just on separate pages . It appears that perhaps tree-shaking can not be used across bundles , i.e . tree shaking is performed first , then what is left is split into bundles . Using that logic , @ example/forms would have been used on multiple pages and would be moved to commons . However this is definitely not optimal , and hopefully is n't what is happening ."

The question I have has to do with the while statement.I remember reading a question here a while back on how JS handles Control flow constructs and logical operators . I think it had something to do with checking if an object had a certain method , and if so , using it 's return value ( if ( event.returnValue & & e.returnValue === true ) kind of stuff ) .I ca n't seem to find that question any more , here 's what I wanted to know : Since the function behaves as I want it to , I think I 'm right in saying that , if step < 0 is false , & & eCode > = ( sCode+=step ) will be ignored , leaving the value of sCode unchanged . When the step check is true , sCode will be in/decremented . I 've put this assignment in brackets , to make sure that the newly assigned value of sCode will be compared to eCode . Again , I assume that the brackets will give priority to the assignment over the logical operator.Is this true for ALL browsers , or is it browser specific to some extent ? is there a chance that this function will increment ( or decrement ) the value of sCode twice in some browsers ? In this case , it 's not that important ( it 's an easy fix to prevent any issues ) . But I want to know if this behaviour is inherent to JavaScript itself , or to the browser implementation .

"Note : while the code in this question deals with functional programming/monads , etc. , I 'm not asking about functional programming ( nor do I think this question should have tags related to functional programming , etc. ) . Instead , I 'm asking about the use of JavaScript 's prototype.Code SourceI 'm watching Douglas Crockford 's video entitled `` Monads and Gonads '' ( on YouTube either here or here ) . He includes a demo implementation of a monad in JavaScript , shown below.The monad Object and its PrototypeIn his code , he creates a truly-empty object using Object.create ( null ) and uses this as the prototype for his eventual monad object . He attaches the bind method to the monad object itself , but any custom functions that are later attached to the monad using lift are attached not to the monad object itself but to its prototype.Prototype Needed ? It seemed to me that the use of a prototype was unnecessary complexity . Why could n't those custom functions simply be attached directly to the monad object itself ? Then , it seemed to me , the prototype would n't be needed , and we could simplify the code.Puzzling Results When Prototype RemovedI tried implementing this simplification and got puzzling results . The non-prototype-using code sometimes still worked , i.e . it could still use the monad-wrapped value ( the string `` Hello world . '' ) when the custom function was invoked with no extra parameters ( monad2.log ( ) ) . However , when the custom function was invoked using extra parameters ( monad2.log ( `` foo '' , `` bar '' ) ) , the code was now unable to find value even though it could still use those extra parameters.Update on Puzzling Results : In part because of the answer from @ amon , I have realized that the puzzling results do not appear because I change the number of parameters , but rather because I simply repeat a call to a lifted method on a monad ( whether or not the number of parameters has changed ) . Thus , running monad2.log ( ) twice in a row will yield the correct value the first time but will be undefined the second time.QuestionsSo , why is the prototype needed in this code ? Or , alternatively , how does eliminating the prototype cause value to be accessible some times but not other times ? Demo Code DescriptionsThe two versions of the code are shown below . The prototype-using code ( MONAD1 ) is identical to the code Crockford uses in his video except that the custom function attached is console.log instead of alert so that I could play with this in node rather than in a browser . The non-prototype-using code ( MONAD2 ) makes the changes indicated in the comments . The output is shown in the comments.The Prototype-Using CodeThe Non-Prototype-Using CodeJSBinI 've played with this code in node , but you can see the results in this jsbin . Console.log does n't seem to work exactly the same in jsbin as it does in node in the terminal , but it still shows the same puzzling aspects of the results . ( The jsbin does n't seem to work if you just click on 'Run ' in the console pane . Rather , you have to activate the output pane by clicking on the 'Output ' tab , and then click on 'Run with js ' in the 'Output ' pane to see the results in the 'Console ' pane . )"

"I 've seen a lot of jQuery code like this , needless to say I do n't like it : I realize people are doing this because the above event binding and handling requires the html structure to be available on the page , but it leads to mixing the presentation , logic and configuration all over the views of the web site .

"I ran into the following problem . My JavaScript structure is like the following.I created an object that contains all the controllers . Those controllers have their own responsibilities . Below code belongs to the main.js file that is called first : main.jsWithin the function init ( ) I call the controllers ' initializers.A controller object looks like the following : uiController.jsAfter all the scripts are loaded , I call the last script init.js : init.jsMy HTML markup looks like the following : Within the functions I use root to select this - that file where I currently been . Normally I create the variable root in every function ( scoped ) and give it the value this . But I thought this could be better , to create in every controller object one empty root ( globally ) , so I 've to only create and add a value once to root , like the following : When I console.log root within the init ( ) function , it will return an object with all the function that lives within the current controller where I am now , in above example App.uiController . So I thought this was working great and I 've to create and declare root only once for each controllers . So I did the same for heroController as I did for uiController and log the variable root to the console . I receive to different objects with the right functions in it : But , here comes the problem . In main.js I called heroController.init ( ) after uiController.init ( ) and When uiController is triggered by an event within the controller , I receive errors in my console that some functions within the uiController not working as expect.When I remove the global root variable inside each controller and declare it in the init controllers like var root = this ; the code will work again.Why does the above setup not work as I expect ? UPDATEBased on the answer from Kingshuk basak , I tried some new things . Here are my thoughts : The answer code is not working for me . It will give me the error : Uncaught ReferenceError : root is not defined . When I use the code from my question and change the root : 0 of the heroController to 1 and log both to the console : console.log ( App.uiController.root , App.heroController.root ) ; I get 0 and 1 in the console . It does n't matter where I place it in both codes , the values will not be overridden by the other ones . This makes it really strange to me.Then I tried also comment out heroController in main.js , then console.log root in the uiController.init ( ) function . The value that I get back is 0 and that 's true , but after that I set root = this ; and console.log directly after it root.root the value will be also 0 and not this as the uiController object . Which makes it even more confusing , why root is n't changing to the object instead of 0 . Also when there is just one root in the hole code , after I comment out heroController.init ( ) in the file main.js . Console.log only root will give me the uiController object as expected.Last , I tried also inside both init ( ) functions this : When I do this , the value of root is for each controller correct , because it will contain the object - this object - with all the corresponding functions in it . But this will leave me with the same problem as mentioned before , that uiController is not working as expect ."

So in the data above on 12/10 : apples : 6 , oranges : 3.Ideally ( in my mind ) I would separate the plotting data from the datehash , and on the hash discard hours/minutes . This would compare the midnight-datehash with the D3 days interval , fill in 0s at midnight on days with missing data , and then plot the real points with hours/minutes intact . I have tried data2 = data.slice ( ) followed by setHours , but the graph still gets the midnight points : Props to nrabinowitz , here is the adapted code : ( I 'm not concerned with 0-points in the hour-scale , just the dailies .

I created a diagram with JointJS cells and now I want to change the label of a cell by clicking on it . When I click on a cell a modal pops up and I enter a new text . The text will be stored in a variable . When the modal closes the label of the clicked cell will be changed to the value of the variable.Now the problem : Let 's say I have four cells and every cell has the label `` a '' . I click on the first cell and change the label to `` b '' . That works . Now I change the label of the second cell to `` c '' and now the problem shows up . Both the first and the second cell have the new label `` c '' . If I change the label of the third cell to `` d '' all the three modified cells have the new label `` d '' .My approach : I have an event listener that executes the function handleClickOnCell ( ) when I click on a cell . The function passes the clicked cell as argument . Inside the function handleClickOnCell ( ) a modal pop up gets triggered . I type in a text and the text value gets assigned to var textLabel . That works . When the modal hides the label gets changed to the value of labelText : Changing the label works but when I change the label of a cell all the previous cells which I have already changed the label one time also change their label to the new label.I do n't know what the problem is . I assume it is a reference problem but I do n't know how to fix it . And I would be grateful for tips or recommendations for a more suitable approach .
"This is a follow up from my previous question.I have a progressbar.js circle that animates on scroll . If there is just one circle it works as expected.Now I want to create many of these animated circles by looping through an object with different key-values pairs.For example : For each key-value pair , the key is a div ID and the value is number that tells the animation how far to go.Below is the code where I try to implement my loop , but the problem is that only the last circle is animated on scroll . All the circles appear in their `` pre-animation '' state , but only the last circle actually becomes animated when you scroll to the bottom.I need each circle to animate once it is in the viewport.While researching this problem I learned that JavaScript will only output the last value of a loop , which I thought could be the cause of my problem.So I tried to replace the for loop with these solutions ... Solution 1 : Same problem as before , only the last loop animates on scroll.Solution 2 : Again , same problem as before , only the last loop animates on scroll.Solution 3 : Again , same problem as before , only the last loop animates on scroll.So now I 'm thinking maybe the problem is not the loop , but something I ca n't see or figure out ."

The basic goal is for each member of one group ( Men ) to meet each member of the other group ( Women ) at their table , once.The conditions are : The number of tables are equal to the number of women.Each man is assigned to a table where a woman is sitting ( 1v1 dialogue ) .In the next round , each man is switched to another table he has not been to before.If the groups are of different size , no member ( man or woman ) must be in pause ( lack a partner ) for two rounds in a row.Difficulty arises when the Men group has more members than the Women group , or vice-versa.Example : Matchups therefore are : So far my attempts at tackling this problem have been unsuccessful , despite looking at similar questions in this site and others ( see screenshot below ) .

I have a JavaScript closure which I keep recreating throughout the life time of my web application ( single full-ajax page ) .I would like to know if it 's creating a memory leak . Here is an example JSFIDDLEThe code in question :

Looking at this simple code which uses Lazy Expressions : The output here is 2.I must say that I thought it should output 5 . However - this would 've been logical if f was closing over the parameter list scope - if it had a scope.Because looking at this other example ( which a bit related ) : This will output 1 . ( Which is the expected result . ) .QuestionWhat 's actually going here with the parameter list scope ? is there any scope here at all ? ( at the parameter list ) I did n't find scope related info in the docs .
"I 'm building a site and one particular operation triggers a long , server-side process to run . This operation ca n't be run twice at the same time , so I need to implement some sort of protection . It also ca n't be made synchronous , because the server needs to continue responding to other requests while it runs.To that end I 've constructed this small concept test , using sleep 5 as a substitute for my actual long-running process ( requires express and child-process-promise , runs on a system with a sleep command but substitute whatever for Windows ) : The intention of this is when `` /test '' is requested it triggers a long operation , and if `` /test '' is requested again while it is running , it replies with `` busy '' and does nothing.My question is , is this implementation safe and correct ? It appears to work in my cursory tests but it 's suspiciously simple . Is this the proper way to essentially implement a mutex + a `` try-lock '' operation , or is there some more appropriate Node.js construct ? Coming from languages where I 'm used to standard multithreading practices , I 'm not quite comfortable with Node 's single-threaded-but-asynchronous nature yet ."

"I found something very odd today : If you create objects with a constructor function and the new keyword , but return a function from the constructor , it behaves like so : The newly-created `` object '' is instead a function.That new function can be invoked like normal , however ...

It 's what you expected to be returned from new.Here 's an example : So if you instantiated it like this : var instance = new Constructor ( ) The following would result : So I guess I have three questions : Is this legal and does it work cross-browser ?

Because : We precise the type= '' email '' attribute and not simply type= '' text '' michael is n't a valid mail.Angular 's compiler is supposed to conform to classic HTML behavior.After testing it , the answer is undefined as expected .

Might I misunderstand some notion ?

My question is this : what is the relation of the first tomorrow ( ) function to the Date object ? What is it attached to , exactly ? Let 's say you were doing this with a normal function that was not intended to be a constructor . Is it possible to call the augmented function from within the original function ? In a constructor function you could do this : but if the function is n't being used as a constructor , obviously the constructor reference would n't exist . Is there another way to access that augmented function ? The impetus behind this question comes from my work reorganizing the JS code for a project . We 're implementing the Sprockets system to split our source code into modules , in which were are basically decorating a base namespace as we go instead of packing it all together in one unreadable inline object definition.We have some pretty epically large event wireup , which is nice to split up into separate functions , but I 'd rather not have to call each function individually ; instead I 'd like a superfunction that calls all of the sub-functions in one go.I could always create an all ( ) function or something to achieve this , but it would look a lot cleaner from an API standpoint if calling a top-level function executed all of the sub-functions that had been attached to it.Thanks to Francisco 's response I now have a working implementation of what I was thinking about .

If CustomForm state changes , and I want to change which rows are passed to BaseClass , I have to throttle with shouldComponentUpdate , re-declare that stage document ( maintaining row object references ) , then call setState on the overarching collection . this.state.stages.content [ 3 ] .jsx is the only thing that changed , but I have to iterate through every row in every stage document in BaseClass when it sees that props.stages changed.Is there some trick to dealing with collections of JSX ? Am I doing something wrong ? This all seems overly-complicated , and I would rather not worsen the problem by following some anti-pattern.Custom Form :"

"Short versionI need to divide an audio signal by another one ( amplitude-wise ) . How could I accomplish this in the Web Audio API , without using ScriptProcessorNode ? ( with ScriptProcessorNode the task is trivial , but it is completely unusable for production due to the inherent performance issues ) Long versionConsider two audio sources , two OscillatorNodes for example , oscA and oscB : Now , consider that these oscillators are LFOs , both with low ( i.e . < 20Hz ) frequencies , and that their signals are used to control a single destination AudioParam , for example , the gain of a GainNode . Through various routing setups , we can define mathematical operations between these two signals.AdditionIf oscA and oscB are both directly connected to the destination AudioParam , their outputs are added together : SubtractionIf the output of oscB is first routed through another GainNode with a gain of -1 , which is then connected to the destination AudioParam , then the output of oscB is effectively subtracted from that of oscA , because we are effectively doing an oscA + -oscB op . Using this trick we can subtract one signal from another one : MultiplicationSimilarly , if the output of oscA is connected to another GainNode , and the output of oscB is connected to the gain AudioParam of that GainNode , then oscB is multiplying the signal of oscA : Division ( ? ) Now , I want the output of oscB to divide the output of oscA . How do I do this , without using ScriptProcessorNode ? EditMy earlier , absolutely ridiculous attempts at solving this problem were : Using a PannerNode to control the positionZ param , which did yield a result that decreased as signal B ( oscB ) increased , but it was completely off ( e.g . it yielded 12/1 = 8.5 and 12/2 = 4.2 ) -- now this value can be compensated for by using a GainNode with its gain set to 12 / 8.48528099060058593750 ( approximation ) , but it only supports values > =1Using an AnalyserNode to rapidly sample the audio signal and then use that value ( LOL ) Edit 2The reason why the ScriptProcessorNode is essentially useless for applications more complex than a tech demo is that : it executes audio processing on the main thread ( ! ) , and heavy UI work will introduce audio glitchesa single , dead simple ScriptProcessorNode will take 5 % CPU power on a modern device , as it performs processing with JavaScript and requires data to be passed between the audio thread ( or rendering thread ) and the main thread ( or UI thread )"

"Out of just intellectual curiosity , why does javascript accept to initialize z ( as z may defined initially ) but without var , it throws an error ( in global space ) ( if z is previously undefined ) In the global space you are not required to use VAR though I get it might be bad practice.Before you say this is a duplicate of questions likeWhat is the purpose of the var keyword and when to use it ( or omit it ) ? Note the declaration that `` If you 're in the global scope then there 's no difference . `` Obviously that 's not 100 % true , given my working example.Is this a quirk or is there legitimate logic ? adding a summary of the answer as I 've learned it : Thanks to Tim ( see below ) the key to my misunderstanding was not realizing this ( fundamental of javascript ) var z ; does absolutely nothing if z already existsThat 's how this expression seems to have it both ways , if you incorrect assume that `` var z '' always initializes.Starting from the left , `` var z '' simply makes sure z is defined but does not actually affect any existing value if it already exists . Then on the right , if z already exists , it is used , if not , the variable was just declared ( but empty ) so it wo n't be used but will not throw an error.This is an excellent article on this kind of scoping and hoisting issue in Javascript : http : //www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-HoistingMany thanks to minitech and everyone else who contributed too !"

But while visiting the page I will have a particular id that needs to get opened by default and also needs to be checked in the checkbox..Kindly help me to achieve the result of opening the respective menu by comparing the id passed down as props and make the respective menu checked.. Struggling for a long time , So please help me.. A big thanks in advance.."

I have looked through all the other ( excellent ) answers on SO ( especially this : How do JavaScript closures work ? ) but I wanted your feedback on my understanding of the concept.I understand that one use case is to hide the implementation of private methods from public access.The other one that I think of is having it as a factory generator : This outputs : So do you think its a valid use case for closures ( i.e . creating multiple factories using the same code base ) ? Or can I achieve the same thing using something much better ? Please note that the question is less about the technical implementation of closures and more about valid use cases in application design / development.Thanks .

"I enjoy working with Google Analytics and the ways that I am able to slice information about our visitors . We use Customer Variables to track information about who and how are users interact with our site . Staying true to the goal of Analytics , we are always looking for ways to improve and optimize our website . Currently we are in a phase of development where we can make choices about how we want to store and present product information . One of the questions that came up was whether or not to show product information in all caps or not . Working with our users for the last few years , it seems that much of our traffic comes from visitors who do have caps lock on . So it got us thinking , could we track our caps lock users with a customer variable to that we can make a more informed determination about how to present the information ? Check out this sample I slapped together : http : //jsfiddle.net/shanabus/Za4kL/Our site basically represents a standard e-commerce site . There are a few different text boxes and that allow you to search for part numbers and throughout the order process there are a few places where users can type text . Would you bind the caps lock test to all text boxes or just the common ones ? Is there a performance hit if I bind the keypress listener to all text boxes on the site or is it negligible ? Is there a better way to implement this ? I imagine instead of showing/hiding a div I would instead set the custom var : Thanks for any thoughts and consideration on this seemingly trivial topic ."

"I ’ ve been reading about undefined in JavaScript and now I am not sure if my understanding is correct .

This is the reason for this question , I need to confirm that what I understand is correct and if I ’ m wrong I would appreciate clarification.Okay , first of all , undefined is property on host object ( window in browsers ) so it ’ s perfectly legal to use : The value of this property is type `` undefined '' . This is one of the JavaScript types along with Object , String , Number and Null . So if I do : I ’ m actually checking against window.undefined property , whatever it contains , is that right ? So this code below would be pretty dumb as this would check someVar only against the string `` undefined '' , not the type nor the property of the window object , right ? This below would be also incorrect as this would check against the window.undefined property ( whatever it contains ) : So , to sum it up , the only proper and cross-browser way to check for undefined is to use typeof e.g . : Is that right ? Also in ES5 window.undefined can not be reassigned but it ’ s perfectly legal in older browsers right ?

"Probably not the correct word . But I want to create a new type in JavaScript . It would have the simple property that one could do this : Basically you would n't have to declare an object literal to extend further . It would create one automatically.This would allow me to build complex structures without having to worry about checking for the existence of a property to extend off of.Instead of doingone could just doand thewould be automatic , i.e . would happen internally.This does have a practical purpose . Particularly I have a registry pattern which I would use this new type to organize data using a more hierarchical approach.Also , I see a pattern , common in libraries , that tests for the existence of an object literal and then creates one if it does not exist.This is a common idiom it seems ."

"I think a firebase function updating a list that I have in the firebase database is being captured by a subscription that is subscribed to that list . From what the list output looks like on my phone ( in the app ) ... and from what my console output looks like ( the way it repeats ) it seems like it is capturing the whole list and displaying it each time one is added . So ( I looked this up ) ... I believe this equation represents what is happening : ( N ( N + 1 ) ) /2It is how you get the sum of all of the numbers from 1 to N. Doing the math in my case ( N = 30 or so ) , I get around 465 entries ... so you can see it is loading a ton , when I only want it to load the first 10.To show what is happening with the output here is a pastebin https : //pastebin.com/B7yitqvD.In the output pay attention to the array that is above/before length - 1 load . You can see that it is rapidly returning an array with one more entry every time and adding it to the list . I did an extremely rough count of how many items are in my list too , and I got 440 ... so that roughly matches the 465 number.The chain of events starts in a page that is n't the page with the list with this function - which initiates the sorting on the firebase functions side : Here is the function on the page with the list that I think is capturing the entire sort for some reason . The subscription is being repeated as the firebase function sorts , I believe.The subscription in loadDistances function works fine as long as I do n't update the list from the other page - another indicator that it might be capturing the whole sort and listing it repeatedly as it sorts.I have tried as as I could think of to unsubscribe from the list after I update ... so then I could just load the list of 10 the next time the page with the list enters , instead of right after the update ( over and over again ) . I know that firebase functions is in beta . Could this be a bug on their side ? Here is my firebase functions code : What is weird is , when I check the firebase functions logs , all of this appears to only run once ... but I still think the subscription could be capturing the whole sorting process in some weird way while rapidly returning it . To be as clear as possible with what I think is going on - I think each stage of the sort is being captured in an ( N ( N + 1 ) ) /2 ... starting at 1 and going to roughly 30 ... and the sum of the sorting ends up being the length of my list ( with 1-10 items repeated over and over again ) ."

"I have the following code to get a key for a given object . So for the object { `` hello '' : { `` data '' : { `` a '' : `` world '' , `` b '' : `` random '' } } } if the key passed in was hello.data.a , the output would be world.I 'm trying to figure out how I can delete a property dynamically in the same fashion . So for example for the same object and key , it would mutate the object to be { `` hello '' : { `` data '' : { `` b '' : `` random '' } } } .Basically I want the same behavior as delete object.hello.data.a . But the problem is the hello.data.a part is a dynamic string passed in . Of course something like delete object [ key ] would n't work since the key has nested levels . It would work if it is only 1 level deep , but would n't work for nested items.One other important note is that performance is extremely important in this case . So although creating a new object and copying over all the properties except for the one I want to delete might work , but I have severe concerns of the performance impact of that vs the delete keyword.Due to other external factors I also do not want to set the property value to null or undefined . I want the key to actually be removed from the object.How can I achieve this ?"

My first approach was incorrect because I was trying to pass the data out of the .then ( ) , but that was wrong practice . I 've tried many approaches , returning the entire promise , trying to return from within the promise ( which did n't work because it 's not allowed ) , and trying to run the async code earlier , and moving the for loops into the promise . None of them worked , this is the closest , where it returns it for PersonC . This was mostly based on other SO questions such as this one , which showed how to use Promise.All.Is this the preoper way of calling a promise ( async function ) for each element of a for loop ? EDIT : Another mistake that was in the code , is that if there is a promise insde a promise , such as the retrieveCheckListItems inside of the asignCheckListItems , it should n't resolve itself , but it should return the value . I updated the code to reflect that , based on the working production code.Apparently another problem I was"

"I 've created a Javascript pseudoclass and I want it to be able to dispatch custom events . Unfortunately , it seems like only DOM nodes are able to dispatch events .

Unfortunately , because the pseudoclass is n't able to dispatch it 's own events , I must add the event listeners to the associated DOM nodes instead.When I do this , my event handler functions receive a reference to the DOM node instead of the pseudoclass instance . I must then determine which pseudoclass instance the DOM node belongs to , before I can call it 's methods.I 'm trying to maintain a clean separation between my Javascript and the DOM , wherever possible . Of course there will be times when it will make sense to associate pseudoclass instances with DOM elements , but I do n't want this to be an absolute requirement.My boilerplate code : My pseudoclassSide note : I need to support legacy browsers such as IE8 .

"I am trying to use a closure to ensure that a function can only execute once . Sounds simple , and it works like this : I have tested the function like so : And it works as expected - 'hi ' gets alerted exactly twice.But then I try to use runOnce ( lazyLoadGrid ) as the callback to a jQuery UI event : And madness ensues . What I expect is that each 'accordion ' on the page will run lazyLoadGrid ( ) exactly once , when that accordion is first opened . Instead , the closure callbacks seem to behave as if they are all referencing the same copy of 'ran ' . lazyLoadGrid ( ) runs the first time I open any accordion , and then never runs again for any other accordion . Logging the pre-condition value of 'ran ' shows that it 's 'true ' every time I click any accordion after the first one.What is the explanation for this ? It may be worth noting I have an odd page , with nested accordions , and multiple jQuery UI tabs each containing accordions . To make matters worse , when I switch tabs the closure actually does run on the first-opened accordion of any given tab . Any advice is much appreciated ."

Elements with visibility : hidden or opacity : 0 are considered visible , since they still consume space in the layout.SourceBut , note that in both I ca n't test the visibility ( by the user ) because : Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to `` none '' or the visibility property to `` hidden '' .

"I think I have finally managed to bend my mind around javascript/ES6 Promises , for the most part . It was n't easy !

I have integrated google analytics and using google tag manager ( tag ) for sending events.While analyzing the events I have noticed that my application is only firing landing pageview event ( Only on first-page user visit ) .What I am not able to figure out is even though the application has fired pageview event only once how page/session > 1 . Can someone please help me understand this mystery and how does Goggle analytics calculate page per session ?

"I am pretty new to the whole object-oriented paradigm.I am trying to model a character in a certain game , you have different levels , classes , and lots of equipment choices and such.My goal in the end would be to create a `` dresser '' of some sort where players could open up the site , try on some equips and see how it influence their parameters , how much it would cost , etc.I already have the main parts programmed ( here ) , but it was my first piece of work with html , css and javascript and it 's just a whole big mess at the moment . I want to start out properly this time : ) Suppose I have an object for the character that we will be simulating : My problem is this : A knight starts out with 1 Defense and 1 morale , different factions will give you different stat boosts . These values can not be reallocated.A player also gains some stat points to spend on different parameters upon leveling and these can be reallocated.Furthermore , a player may equip some equipments that give stat boosts , and these can not be reallocated as well ( only by unequiping it ) .What I 've done previously is that I created a whole bunch of arrays all with their indices corresponding to each of the parameters , each array representing the default stat boost from different factions , the total stat boost from equipments , and the stats the player allocated manually . I then sum each of the indices to give me a final array of parameters to display . A player can then only reallocate points in the 3rd array , and not any other arrays.How should I go about implementing this using object-oriented programming ?

"I 've seen a lot of idioms , most of them clever and logical once explained . But while I was looking over SO 's javascript to get some ideas about good interface design I saw the following line : Which really threw me for a loop . Obviously , they initialize the tag renderer with two arrays containing exactly one null-string argument ( or [ `` '' ] , which `` '' .split ( `` `` ) evaluates to ) . That part I understand ( having done the same thing in my own code ) . But it seems like passing a literal would accomplish the same thing.Is there some non-obvious reason for doing this that I 'm failing to see as a newcomer ( to js , not programming ) ? Also , I did try searching , and got lots of info on split ( ) itself ( which I already understand quite well ) , but not the idiom ; Googling for double quotes is pretty fruitless.Edit : It was the obvious answer . This part of the code is dynamically generated , and is not usually populated on SO proper ."

"Google Analytics initially uses a _gaq [ object Array ] . Passing an array to a function is in JavaScript passing an object , thus by reference . ( Edit : As pointed out in answers , the reference is passed by value . See https : //stackoverflow.com/a/5314911/120521 for more details on reference/value passing in JavaScript . ) The code below uses jQuery to wait for the DOM to load , then attach a change event which will send a virtual pageview to Google Analytics once the user changes < input/ > field.However , as can be seen in the comment above , the trackInputs ( ) method prints the 'original ' array . Ordinarily what the Google Analytics script does is it changes the _gaq array into a _gaq object and alters the push prototype for the object to have it make requests to the Google Analytics servers once a new call is pushed to the object.Why is n't this alteration also passed by reference into trackInputs ( ) ? I realise the loaded Google Analytics script will ( or will it ? ) occur after the Tracking.trackInputs ( ) definition , so the browser might not understand it is now an [ object object ] but will persist in thinking it was the original [ object Array ] . But , then it is not a reference anymore , is it ?

"I need to loop through a JavaScript object treating it as an array with custom keys.I know this is not fully supported , since properties have no instrinsic order , but since I always reorder the properties , I found this approach simple and reliable ... until now.The problem occurs when the keys are numbers , or strings that can be casted as numbers.When I run this code : the output is : Which means : ( test1 ) if the keys are below 2^32 ( 4,294,967,296 ) , they are automatically reordered , the smallest first ( test2 ) if the keys are above 2^32 , they are NOT reordered.The question is : why is this happening ? Since all the browsers I tested ( Google Chrome 79.0 , Mozilla Firefox 71.0 , Microsoft Edge 44.18362 , Internet Explorer 11.535 ) agree about this output , there must be some official specification.UpdateI tested a lot of numbers before finding out it was a threshold matter .

"This does not work : Firefox throws me a nasty exception on line myElement.callMe ( ) . Apparently , `` myElement.callMe is not a function '' .I am confused why is that so ? To my understanding , as soon as I type const myElement = document.createElement ( 'my-element ' ) , I am receiving an object whose type is not a generic HTMLElement but an object of my class I wrote that extends HTMLElement ! And this class exposes callMe.I have confirmed that my use of modules seems to be the culprit here . This code works as expected : Yes I know that things defined in a module are scoped to this module . But here it does not even seem ( to me ) to be a scoping issue . For example , if I do inside a module something like that : then I will be able to use callMe outside of the module anyway , because the module exposed this function through other means than export ( this time through assigning it to the global window object ) .The same , to my understanding , should be happening in my use case . Even though I define callMe in a class scoped to the module , this class method should be accessible outside of the module by the virtue of it being a property of an object of this class that is exposed by calling document.createElement ( 'my-element ' ) . Yet manifestly , this does not happen.This is really weird to me . It almost seems as if the module was enforcing its scoping by tangling with types unrelated functions return ( ! ! ) - so in this case , it is just as if the module magically forces document.createElement to cast the object it returns up in the inheritance hierarchy ( to HTMLElement ) ? ! ? ! This is mind-blowing to me.Could someone please clear my confusion ? ( And if I define a custom element inside a module , how may I expose its API outside of this module ? )"

But when I added a second submenu group ( under `` SETTINGS '' ) it broke . I 'm looking for a way to make it so no matter how many submenu groups I have the main item 's blue line should be visible when my mouse is over it 's submenu items and return to activeItem when I 'm no longer hovering it .

"There are a couple rules that are arguably good to follow when writing code : Code is easier to read and reason about when there 's no reassignment ; many linters recommend preferring const whenever possible.Code is also easier to read and reason about when objects do not get mutated . If you define an object in one part of the code , it 's helpful to know that you may freely reference that object elsewhere , and it will be exactly the same.In most cases , these rules are just fine , and both of them can be followed without issue . But is it possible to follow them both when implementing a module which has both setter and getter functionality ( which is a very common pattern in programming ) ? For example : I ca n't think of how one could possibly implement something like this without either mutating or reassigning somewhere - but such things should be avoided . Is what I 'm looking for possible , or is it simply a fact of life that I must choose one or the other , and I should just shrug and pick one ? If I called the module with the data to set it with initially , and never set its data again , it would be possible , but this approach is very inflexible and will not fulfill most useful use-cases.I 'm not necessarily looking for a solution that follows all the principles of functional programming ( though , if one exists , it 'd be interesting to see ) , but this general problem is probably familiar to those who use functional programming ."

"I often do stuff like this : But I actually want to permit 0 , and 0 || 24 === 24 , instead of 0.I 'm wondering what the best pattern is to take user input from command line , or input from wherever , and do the same logic , only treat zero as truthy . I think the best pattern I 've found is to do exactly that : Firstly , it permits things like 'abc ' , which is really wrong . But if I put in an early + it lets null slide through , which is also wrong . Secondly , very ugly , because it 's clearly working around a language deficiency rather than doing something elegant with the language tools available . And not terribly readable . I 'm doing something that is one line of thought and I 'd like to do it in one actual line of code ( not one line on technicality , like this is ) . But most other ideas I have had get even uglier : Note that this actually would work with string - if i were interested in accepting `` '' , thenSince there is no NaN hole , and this is intelligently readable : if we have a string use that , otherwise use defaut.Or this route : So I still like my hacky ternary and boolean logic better . Yes , I am looking for a condensed , one-line solution , since JS is rife with patterns and what would be clever in many other languages is well-recognized and readable and clear in JS . But I 'm novice and trying to learn good patterns , hence , this question.To be more explicit on the requirements:0 needs to go to 0.undefined needs to go to 24.All actual numbers under typeof need to go to themselves , except NaN.I strongly feel null should go to 24 because I very rarely use JS code that treats null and undefined differently on purpose . I feel it 's better to keep it that way.I slightly feel NaN should go to 24 because this more closely follows the || pattern . Falsy things should go to default . 'abc ' should go to 24 - in my real application this is user input , and the user should not mistakenly type , say an email . '123abc ' should ideally go to 24 , which conversion to Number catches but parseInt does not . I believe emails can start with numbers , so this drives the point home that this is something that ought to be caught.Underscore or lodash answers are acceptable , in particular , to those of you who have lectured me on trying to be `` clever '' instead of writing a 2-3 line function . Those libraries exist precisely because there are many simple 2-3 line functions accomplishing the same thing in many places in many code bases all over the world , and it 's far more readable and maintainable and robust to have those isolated as something like , say , _.readNumber . If no such method exists and I am able to come up with general enough requirements , I will submit a poll request myself and post that as answer to this question . This is something I like about JS - it has good ecosystem in that it 's very possible to not have to write these utility methods . Since I 'm particularly dealing with user input it may be better for me to write a slightly more specialized function and submit to commander.js , which is where I keep needing this ."
"Disclaimer : my question is not focused on the exercise , it 's just an example ( although if you have any interesting tips on the example itself , feel free to share ! ) .Say I 'm working with parsing some strings with Regex in JavaScript , and my main focus is performance ( speed ) .I have a piece of regex which checks for a numeric string , and then parses it using Number if it 's numeric : Note how the conditional test does not have a capture group around the digits . This leads to writing out basically the same regex twice , except with a capture group the second time.What I would like to know is this ; does adding a capture group to a regex used alongside test ( ) in a condition affect performance in any way ? I 'd like to simply use the capture regex in both places , as long as there is no performance hit.And to the question as why I 'm doing test ( ) then match ( ) rather than match ( ) and checking null ; I want to keep parsing as fast as possible when there 's a miss , but it 's ok to be a little slower when there 's a hit . If it 's not clear from the above , I 'm referring to JavaScript 's regex engine - although if this differs across engines it 'd be nice to know too . I 'm working specifically in Node.js here , should it also differ across JS engines.Thanks in advance !"

I 'm trying to create a JavaScript card game and want to pick 5 cards without repetition : How can I make sure that there is no repetition if I pick 5 cards ?
"The first couple paragraphs describe what I 'm trying to achieve , the actual question is at the end . ThanksPreviously , I 've simply been using new keyword to create objects , and prototypes to assign methods and handle inheritance . Recently , however , ( partially inspired by CoffeeScript-generated JS ) I decided to play with an object-creating function that would look something like this : I would then create a new object like this : This approach has a couple of advantages over the typical approach that uses new for every instance . First , I 'm much less likely to forget using the word new ( I know there are other ways of avoiding new , but from what I 've seen they have similar problems to the one I describe below ) , and second , I can easily see 'private ' variables that constructor sees in any function that 's now part of the class . I did run into a caveat when testing it though . instanceof no longer works because it does n't see the inner-scoped object Test . To work around that , I tried to use constructor property instead : And this is what got me confused . Creating the same objects without using an object-creating function would cause their constructor to be equal , but in this case they differ . My guess is that what 's happening is that a brand new object type gets generated every time the function runs ( the object structure is the same , but the instance of the prototype is different ) .If my understanding of the problem is correct , does that also mean that the code is allocating additional memory per object instance to my JavaScript for functions that should be shared between instances by tricking it to create an identical object prototype for each instance ( defeating the entire purpose of using prototype ) ? If so , is there a good way to avoid this while still keeping the benefits of this pattern ( ability to share private variables between internal functions and not having to use new keyword ) ? If I 'm misunderstanding the problem , can someone enlighten me on what 's actually happening ?"
"I am trying to write a web worker that performs an interruptible computation . The only way to do that ( other than Worker.terminate ( ) ) that I know is to periodically yield to the message loop so it can check if there are any new messages .

"I am working on an Angular application using PrimeNG Full Calendar component , this one : https : //primefaces.org/primeng/showcase/ # /fullcalendarThat is based on the Angular FullCalendar component , this one : https : //fullcalendar.io/Here you can find my entire code : https : //bitbucket.org/dgs_poste_team/soc_calendar/src/master/I am finding some difficulties trying to dinamically change the background color of the event rendered on my calendar . I have to have different event background color based on different event information ( the start event time , for example : if an event start at 07:00 is green , if it start at 15:00 it is red , if it start at 23:00 it is blue , but this logic is not important at this time ) .In my project I am dragging external event into my calendar , something like this : https : //fullcalendar.io/docs/external-dragging-demoSo , as you can see in my BitBucket repository I have this FullcalendarComponent handling the component that contains the calendar that recives events from an external component : As you can see this object contains the eventReceive ( ) method listening for the drag and drop event . So I can drag an object from a list event component into this calendar . At the moment I have commented out this line : to avoid event duplication in my calendar ( I will explain this soon ) .So the when an event is dragged into my calendar it is inserted into an array of events by this service method : where eventData is defined as BehaviorSubject into my service class , in this way : To show the event on the calendar I am using this approach ( instead use the eventReceiveEvent.event.setAllDay ( false , { maintainDuration : true } ) ; because to make this color decision automatic whenever a event is added I do : whenever I will push new event through my addEvent ( ) method of service -- > my subscription in ngoninit of component will receive updated data and apply background colors displaying the event with the right color.Ok it seems to works fine excetp the night use case ( hour value equal to 23 ) .Here a printscreen showing the problem:1 ) I insert a MORNING EVENT ( starting at 07:00 ) and I obtain this correct behavior:2 ) I insert a AFTERNOON EVENT ( starting at 15:00 ) and I obtain this correct behavior:3 ) I insert now a NIGHT EVENT ( from 23:00 ) and I obtain this absolutly strange behavior : As you can see the problem is that the event is dublicated , in particualar : The BLACK background event was correctly added into the subscription function defined into the ngOnInit ( ) ( this is the correct one ) .The BLUE background event ( that have not to be added ) is added by : And I ca n't understand why ! ! ! At the beginning of the post I say that I removed this line from the **eventReceive ( ) method : this because , if enabled , also the morning and afternoon event will have the same duplication behavior.What is the problem ? What is wrong with my code ? How can I try to fix it ?"

"This code best demonstrates my confusion.Whoa , wait , what 's going on ? 1.Why am I getting different results ?

Ok no , I just hate IE , but that 's another story . Why is jQuery behaving so strange ? Hanging out with IE too much I think ...

From a question asked over here about replacing ordinary text within a string into a URL ... . I want to make it work if the link text is surrounded by < br/ > tags . This is the code I am using so far which does 'linkify ' text within an element that appears to be a hyperlink : Of course the problem is that if the link text is like this : < p > Is this : < br/ > < br/ > http : //www.google.com < br/ > < br/ > THE best search engine around ? < /p > Then the output I get ends up being this ! < p > Is this : < a href= '' http : //www.google.com '' > http : //www.google.comTHE < /a > best search engine around < /p > So two problems are that the < br/ > tags are getting stripped out completely and also that the text after the < br/ > tag ( 'THIS ' ) is being treated as part of the hyperlink text.How could I overcome this small but deadly issue ?

"I was looking for some micro optimizations of some JavaScript legacy code I was revisiting and noticed that in most frequently called for loops , counters were declared once in the global scope , outside the functions using them . I was curious whether that was indeed an optimization therefore I have created the following test case in JavaScript : What happens is that letItNotBe ( ) runs significantly faster than letItBe ( ) , in Chrome , Firefox and also NodeJS Chrome : NodeJS : Changing let with var makes no difference.Initally my logic was that declaring a new counter variable every time a function is called would be indeed slower than if a variable is initially declared and then simply reset to 0 . However , it turns out to be quite the oposite and the difference in execution time is quite substential . My simple explanation is that when the counter variable is declared ouside the function using it , in some way the JS transpiler needs to refer to this variable . And since it is in the parent scope it takes more executions to reference it when incrementing . However that 's just blind guessing.Can anybody give any meaningful explanation why this is happening , since I need to refactor the code and give a meaningful explanation mysefl besides the test that I already have : ) Thanks ."

"Goal : I 'm looking for a way in javaScript/jQuery to size a textarea so that it initially shows all of its text content , hide the vertical scrollbar , and show the resize handle.The code that is below , first shows the textarea with some content , but not enough that the vertical scrollbar appears . This would be fine , except I want the textarea to look like this no matter how much text it contains , that is showing no vertical scrollbar.When you click the button , more text is added and the vertical scrollbar shows , which is what I to avoid when I say initially when there is too much content -- the textarea should expand to fit it , which I try to do with the next two button clicks.Clicking the button again causes the textarea to widen , so that none of the current lines wrap.Clicking the button again , now causes the textarea to grow taller so the vertical scrollbar no longer shows.However , the textarea grows too much and a gap shows between the last line of text and the bottom line of the textarea . Not what I want.If the textarea 's scrollHeight represents the whole height of the contents of the textarea , and there are no empty lines at the bottom , why is there a gap ? UpdateThe codePen works for up to 1000 lines when the Rows option is used . After 999 lines then adjusting the textarea 's rows attribute no longer works because each row wraps to two lines , so after 999 , the rows would probably need to add 2 to the rows attribute ( not tested ) to prevent the vertical scrollbar from showing , but up to 999 lines is most likely good enough for almost any situation.Thank you ."

I have a simple problem that I just ca n't seem to figure out . In the code below I get an error ( test_str is not defined ) because the line defining `` var str= '' is spread across two lines .

"This happens only in Firefox.Important : I am saving the caret 's position with rangy.saveSelection ( ) : when click the content editable divon keyupwhen adding an external html element ( as a node ) to the content editable divI need the position saved constantly through multiple means to be able to insert html elements on click ( I have some tags ) .When I click in the contentEditable div and the div is empty ( first focus , let 's say ) , I can not see the caret unless I start typing .

"I want to implement a big file downloading ( approx . 10-1024 Mb ) from the same server ( without external cloud file storage , aka on-premises ) where my app runs using Node.js and Express.js.I figured out how to do that by converting the entire file into Blob , transferring it over the network , and then generating a download link with window.URL.createObjectURL ( … ) for the Blob . Such approach perfectly works unless the files are small , otherwise it will be impossible to keep the entire Blob in the RAM of neither server , nor client.I 've tried to implement several other approaches with File API and AJAX , but it looks like Chrome loads the entire file into RAM and only then dumps it to the disk .

And I 'm find myself to really abuse of the var that = this ; thing.. I have it in almost each method in the class.How can I avoid this ? I like OOP but I 'm curious to explore this new trendy js , with some functional feature and with the asynch everywhere . What is the correct way to handle this problem in JS ? How can I avoid to write var that = this ; in each method every time I use a callback ?"

"Goal : Display a post excerpt for each post in the post list of an Eleventy blogI 'm adapting this starter project as my own blog.I 'm referring to this Eleventy documentto get the post excerpt.My code : I started by editing my .eleventy.js to enable gray-matter excerpt , per the above document , like so : Next , I added `` -- - '' following the first paragraph in some blog posts , per the example.Finally , I updated /_includes/postslist.njk to include a reference to the excerpt for each post , so my new file now reads : but no excerpts appear.What I 've TriedI 've checked for empty paragraph tags in the output HTML , and they are not there , so the ifcondition itself is failing.I 've tried setting the excerpt separator to something other than the default '' -- - '' , with the same result.Importantly , I 've tried disabling excerpts in the .eleventy.js , which causes the separator tobe read as regular markdown . This is important because it shows that gray-matter is correctlyreading my separators in the blog posts as separators , and therefore the problem must be in my/_includes/postslist.njk.ConclusionHow do I reference the excerpt that Eleventy generates from gray-matter ?

"I have been learning hooks in react for the past couple of days , and I tried creating a scenario where I need to render a big grid on screen , and update the background color of the nodes depending on the action I want to take . There are two actions that will change the background color of a node , and these two actions must coexist.The cursor hovers a node while it is clicked.There exists an algorithm inside the Grid component that will change backgrounds of some of the nodes.The way I see it , there are multiple ways I can achieve this , but I am having some trouble with the way hooks were intended to be used . I will first walk you through my thought process on how this could be achieved from what I learned , and then show you the implementation that I tried . I tried to keep the important parts of the code so it can be understood clearly . Please let me know if I missed somethings or misunderstood a concept completely.The children can hold their own state and know how to update themselves . The parent can hold the reference to each children of the list , and call the necessary function from the reference of the child when it is needed in order to update the children.Works well for the first and the second action to be taken . This solution causes no performance issues since the children manage their own state , and if the parent updates the children state via reference , the only child to be re-rendered will be the one that gets called.This solution is seen as an anti-pattern from what I read . 2 . The state of the children could be given as props from the parent , any update operation can be achieved inside the parent . ( Children gets updated correctly , render gets called in only the necessary children , but the DOM seems to stutter . If you move the mouse at a certain speed , nothing happens , and every visited node gets updated at once . ) Does n't work for the first action . Children gets updated correctly , render gets called in only the necessary children , but the DOM seems to stutter . If you move the mouse at a certain speed , nothing happens and every visited node gets updated at once.I have two questions that I want to ask on this topic.In the first implementation ; the parent component does n't re-render when a node changes its ' state . Is it wrong to just utilize this anti-pattern if it is beneficial in this kind of situations ? What may be the cause of the stutter that the second implementation suffers from ?

"I 've a div that I 'd like to maximise the size of , within a parent that 's based on a 100vh.The problem being that I have two p divs that can also change their height based on the width of the window , leading to a varying size.Now the quick and dirty solution might simply be to run a jQuery snippet to detect the sizes of the parent div and p divs and set the div 's height based on these , running the function on doc.ready and on window.onresize.But that feels unnecessary , and I 'm wondering if there 's a neater solution using only CSS that I 'm unaware of ?

I 'm trying to figure out a way to structure a new framework for work capable of injecting plugins . The idea is to have each file be loaded asynchronously.Here is how I would love to configure my plugins : As I 'd be using inline functions ( within the DOM ) I thought of using a command queue which on load would invoke all pushed functions ( a bit like the googletag cmd of DFP ) .As stated before each plugin would be loaded asynchronously so the initialization of each of them should only start when all of them are loaded ( hence the then ( ) function ) .Here you have my script : Here you have the basic cmd functionality which would be overridden and the loading of each of the scripts . What I ca n't seem to figure is how to fire up the then ( ) . I suppose you 'd keep track of it in the _loadExternalJS ( ) in it 's onload event ( as you can see in the code ) . But Simply adding an if ( amountPluginsLoaded === pluginsLoaded.length ) { fire all inits } seems unproductive and not something that belongs in the function . this is why I 'd love to implement some then ( ) feature.Any ideas/opinions ?

"In a NodeJS 6.10.2/SailsJS 0.12.13 based JavaScript application I experience since several months a strange error behavior.In a Sails controller , I try to retrieve a property of a literal object : However , in my case someObject is undefined . So , I 'd expect to get an error like ' Can not read property someProperty of undefined . ' - and then either Node.js to stop completely or the code to go on ( with the next console.log ) .Instead , the code simply stops executing at that point and I get a strange warning : `` ( node:4822 ) Warning : Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected . 11 close listeners added . Use emitter.setMaxListeners ( ) to increase limit . '' It is however , unpredictable how often this error occurs . Somethings only once , somethings about 20 times right after each other.What I found out so for is that it is somehow connected to the question whether there was already a response or not . Consider the following : This will result in Sending 500 ( `` Server Error '' ) response : ReferenceError : someObject is not defined - exactly what I expect.However , now I first send some response and then trying to access my non existing property , turning the code into : then I often get simply nothing : 'Yeah ! ' displayed , but nothing comes afterwards . The event listener error is sometimes there , sometimes not . Very strange.Additionally , and strange enough , the problem seems to be somehow connected to the time passed since the start of Sails . I put the code you see above inside a Sails controller function which is called immediately after the clients re-connect . I then played around with the timeout values , restarting the Sails server several times . Outcome : If I set the timeout to 1s , in 4 of 5 tests , I will get the correct error behavior . For 10 seconds it is about 50 % , for 30s the error will always be ignored without any console output.However , if I put my test code outside of the Sails controller , I always get the correct error behavior by Node . So , I 'm quite sure this is a wrong behavior of Sails , not Node ."

"Back in the day ( yes I really am this old ) you could reference scripts out of a renamed zip file like this This was supported on IE4 , NS4 and Opera5 with identical mark-up and semantics , but has been consigned to the digital scrapyard . Why ? OK for those of you interested in the answer but not interested enough to trawl through an old message thread ( see comments below ) the long and the short of it is that you get the compression from the transport layer merely by specifying Content-Encoding : gzip so it is inappropriate to support mark-up in the presentation layer and therefore it was removed . This also improves granularity because script files are individually versioned in the cache.Given the transport layer use of gzip , what is the point of minification ? The gzip dictionary tokenising pass will achieve this over the wire without producing a horrible debugger experience.I agree that concatenation will improve the compression yield . I suppose some server/browser combinations might fail to use gzip , in which case minification would help ."

"I 'm pretty new to ReactJS and redux , so I 've never really had to work with this before . I 'm retrieving data from an API call in my project . I want to modify the data by adding a new property to the object . However , because the code is not ran synchronously , the unmodified array is being returned ( I assume ) instead of the modified array.As you can see , I perform an API call which returns data named response . The array is populated with all `` things '' . If things exists , I want to load extra information named `` items '' . Based on the information in the things array , I will perform another API call ( which is done by dispatching the loadItems function ) which returns another promise . Based on the data in the results of that API call , I will push into the items property ( which is an array ) of the things object.As you can see in the comments , if I loop through the things array and log the items property which I just created , it 's basically returning 0 as length , which means the things array is being returned before the things array is being modified . I would like to know two things : What is causing my code to run async . Is it thedispatch ( loadItems ( itemName ) ) function since it returns a promise ?

Probably because return things is being executed outside of that promise.I 'd really love to know what is going onEditI have added the loadItems ( ) code to the question , as requested :"

"Functionality : User to play a time-based game in game page .

Whenever the form is submitted , only the first field gets cleared out , since most of the time the drop-downs remain the same , however , since the script works whenever there is a change in the primary drop-down , since the load upon does not constitute a change , it just keeps the selected/submitted option on the primary drop-down , and will just display an empty secondary drop-down , even when the primary option selected does have secondary options . I got most of the JS from the drop-down from a tutorial , as I am not very familiar with it .

I do n't care so much about the station clearing , but more about not having an empty drop-down that should not be empty.And when I look at the data that remained in the form , only the work area stayed , because the dependent dropdown does not load until you select another option from the drop down , and if you wanted to be able to see the Box Assembly options again , you 'd have to click another option and then go back to Box Assembly ( for example ) How could I fix this issue ?

"My component seems to enter an endless loop and I can not find the reason . I am using the useEffect and useState hooks but that is not it . To anyone wanting to tag this as duplicate : Please read the issue carefully . This endless re-render loop scenario only happens if : The mouse is moved too fastA user clicks anything inside the developer console and then triggers a mousemove event after ( for the purpose of explenation clarity I 've omitted the mousedown/mouseup handlers , but they are essentially the same as the mousemove handler , triggering a call to every subscribed callback.Here is an example , but be careful it can cause an infinite loop and force you to close the browser tabCodesandbox : https : //codesandbox.io/s/infiniteloopissue-lynhw ? file=/index.jsI am using Map.forEach to trigger the setState of any subscribers on mousemove event . ( You can see the relevant code below ) , and I am using useEffect to subscribe/unsubscribe from this `` update event '' One thing that `` fixes '' the problem is the following - Check for a Reference Point comment ( below in the Mouse Consumer ) . If the callback is removed as a dependency of the useCallback hook , everything works fine . But this is not good , because in this example , we obviously just extract the data into the state , but that callback function could be dependent on , say some other state , in which case it would not work . The callback needs to be mutable.My guess is that the react somehow manages to re-render BEFORE the .forEach finishes it 's iterations , in which case it would unsubscribe ( thus removing the key ) , and re-subscribe ( thus adding it again ) triggering yet another callback , which then triggers another unsub/resub and we go into a loop . But that should n't be possible right ? I mean javascrip is suppose to be blocking single threaded , how/why does react re-render in the middle of a forEach loop ? Also , does someone have a better idea on how to `` subscribe '' to a mousemove and run the callback . I recently saw some EventEmitter in some back-end code , but am not familiar with it . Am also not sure if that could fix the issue here , the issue being react takes precedence when updating over waiting for the main thread to finish a .forEach loop ( at least I think that is it ) The base is simple : App.jsComponent.jsThe idea behind the component is , to write down the current mouse position on screen at all times . This information could be readily available in the context , however in order to render it on the screen , we need to trigger a `` ReRender '' so Context API is not a solution , instead . Mouse ProviderSo every time the user moves his mouse , the mousemove handler will update the static object . The Provider component itself DOES NOT rerender.Mouse ConsumerAs we can see , the Consumer Hook implements two functions , which subscribe and unsubscribe the id into the Map of callbacks , previously referenced in the Provider , that is ALL it does , it does n't call the callback , it never triggers anything other then adding/removing the callback from the Map object.All of the `` updating '' is done by the Provider or rather the component who 's callback the provider calls , on every mousemove . In other words , the useEffect does n't EVER trigger a state update , mouse interaction does.The useEffect hook returns an unsubscribe function which makes sure it `` cleans up after itself '' so that the callback does n't get triggered if the component is dismounted.The ProblemWell as I said the problem is , I end up in an endless re-render loop with this component , and it only happens if the mouse is moved too fast or if it goes `` offscreen '' such as into the developer console , for example . EDIT : removed context entirely , was not necessary and was causing confustion.EDIT2 : added codesandbox"
"Update ( Mar 2nd , 2020 ) It turns out that the coding in my example here was structured in just the right way to fall off a known performance cliff in the V8 JavaScript engine ... See the discussion over on bugs.chromium.org for the details . This bug is now being worked on and should be fixed in the near future.Update ( Jan 9th , 2020 ) I tried to isolate the coding that behaves in the manner described below into a single page Web app , but in doing so , the behaviour disappeared ( ? ? ) . However , the behaviour described below does still exist in the context of the full application.That said , I have since optimised the fractal calculation coding and this problem is no longer an issue in the live version . Should anyone be interested , the JavaScript module that manifests this problem is still available hereOverviewI 've just completed a small Web-based app to compare the performance of browser-based JavaScript with Web Assembly . This app calculates a Mandelbrot Set image , then as you move the mouse pointer over that image , the corresponding Julia Set is dynamically calculated and the calculation time is displayed.You can switch between using JavaScript ( press ' j ' ) or WebAssembly ( press ' w ' ) to perform the calculation and compare runtimes.Click here to see the working appHowever , in writing this code , I discovered some unexpectedly strange JavaScript performance behaviour ... Problem SummaryThis problem seems to be specific to the V8 JavaScript engine used in Chrome and Brave . This problem does not appear in browsers using SpiderMonkey ( Firefox ) or JavaScriptCore ( Safari ) . I have not been able to test this in a browser using the Chakra engineAll the JavaScript code for this Web app has been written as ES6 ModulesI 've tried rewriting all the functions using the traditional function syntax rather than the new ES6 arrow syntax . Unfortunately , this does not make any appreciable differenceThe performance problem seems to relate to the scope within which a JavaScript function is created . In this app , I call two partial functions , each of which gives me back another function . I then pass these generated functions as arguments to another function that is called inside a nested for loop.Relative to the function within which it executes , it appears that a for loop creates something resembling its own scope ( not sure its a full-blown scope though ) . Then , passing generated functions across this scope ( ? ) boundary is expensive.Basic Coding StructureEach partial function receives the X or Y value of the mouse pointer 's position over the Mandelbrot Set image , and returns the function to be iterated when calculating the corresponding Julia set : These functions are called within the following logic : The user moves the mouse pointer over the image of the Mandelbrot Set triggering the mousemove eventThe current location of the mouse pointer is translated to the coordinate space of Mandelbrot set and the ( X , Y ) coordinates are passed to function juliaCalcJS to calculate the corresponding Julia Set.When creating any particular Julia Set , the above two partial functions are called to generate the functions to be iterated when creating the Julia SetA nested for loop then calls function juliaIter to calculate the colour of every pixel in the Julia set . The full coding can be seen here , but the essential logic is as follows : As you can see , the functions returned by calling makeJuliaXStepFn and makeJuliaYStepFn outside the for loop are passed to juliaIter which then does all the hard work of calculating the colour of the current pixelWhen I looked at this structure of code , at first I thought `` This fine , it all works nicely ; so nothing wrong here '' Except there was . The performance was much slower than expected ... Unexpected SolutionMuch head scratching and fiddling around followed ... After a while , I discovered that if I move the creation of functions juliaXStepFn and juliaYStepFn inside either the outer or inner for loops , then the performance improves by a factor of between 2 and 3 ... WHAAAAAAT ! ? So , the code now looks like thisI would have expected this seemingly insignificant change to be somewhat less efficient , because a pair of functions that do not need to change are being recreated each time we iterate the for loop . Yet , by moving the function declarations inside the for loop , this code executes between 2 and 3 times faster ! Can anyone explain this behaviour ? Thanks"
"I am currently following a javascript course and am having issues understanding what is happening behind the scenes in javascript in one of the examples ( see code below ) .I understand most of the code and understand why the output logged is - > [ false , true , true ] .

But now what happens ? The function inside the checkPastLimitSimplified function is not executed yet but just returned . What does it look like when it is returned ? at what point do the limiter variables receive the parameter 1 ? I understand that .bind ( this , limiter ) ; creates a copy of the function .

"Trying to learn Elm with a background in JS and little experience in strongly- and statically-typed languages , I find that the major difficulty revolves around the type syntax ( and what types are useful for in Elm generally ) . Unfortunately , I do n't find the docs very helpful in this respect.If I take the simple example here : http : //elm-lang.org/examples/buttons , the line : defines a union type Msg as `` being '' either Increment or Decrement . It seems to suggest that Increment and Decrement are types too . What are they exactly ? ( They 're not defined elsewhere in the example , nor are they predefined types ) .Then , they are used in the view function as an argument of onClick . Now , they seem to act like a kind of `` message '' ( whatever that means ) . In JS , this would probably be achieved by assigning a value to a ( mutable ) variable in each case -- which of course ca n't be the Elm way . So , is the way types work related to the topic of immutability ?

"I have a library , written in Typescript , that is being distributed in 2 files : a compiled ECMAScript-2015 compatible Javascript file index.js and a Typescript declaration file index.d.ts . My goal is to make library accessible for both Javascript and Typescript developers ( so that they have proper typings and autocomplete ) .Lately I have upgraded to Typescript 3.9.7 , and decided to refactor my code to use new private class fields declaration that utilizes # sigil instead of Typescript 's private keyword.To my surprise , my index.d.ts file become non-compatible with old Typescript versions due to including the # private ; member on my classes.Here is a comparison between old Typescript code generating old declaration file , and a new refactored Typescript code that generates a new non-compatible declaration file . The old code utilizing private keyword : The new refactored code that uses # sigil to declare private names : Here is a page at Typescript playground that contains that sample code.Now , if my customer that uses an old Typescript ( let 's say , version 3.7 ) will fetch my library ( consisting of compiled index.js and declaration file index.d.ts , without the source index.ts file ) and rely on index.d.ts types , they 'll see the following error : The origin of that error is clear ( the # sigil ) , so my questions are following : Is it okay if I postprocess my index.d.ts and remove the # private ; line before I ship my library to customers , that do n't have to know about implementation details ? I can easily do that by using ttsc package , but I still worry that piece of typing information might be somehow important.What is the practical use for # private ; line in index.d.ts ? Why would a declaration file expose that a class utilizes private fields , if they ca n't be accessed anyway , and are implementation details ? According to a topic in Typescript Github issues , this is the intended behavior so that classes with private fields retain their nominal typing behavior when emitted to a .d.ts file . Sadly , the meaning of that explanation slips away from me . Is there any extra documentation I can read to better understand the nominal typing behavior of Typescript ?"

"I am currently developing a website that is pure javascript and relies heavily on the jQuery & jQuery UI libraries ( this site is not intended for use by a general public , hence progressive enhancement is not a strict requirement for this project ) . I am encountering a significant memory leak on executing the following code : At any given time in this dialog box , I am creating , removing and modifying a large number of instances of jQuery UI buttons , multiselects ( per the Multiselect widget created by Eric Hynds ) and on click event handlers . According to jQuery UI documentation , calling .remove ( ) on oDialogBox should result in all child widgets being unbound and deleted . Yet my detached DOM tree shows a significant number of garbage elements that the GC is n't collecting.It is highly likely I have missed a large set of closures that need to be finished off safely . How do I do the following:1 ) How do I identify which closures are keeping a given detached DOM object alive ( either in Firefox or Chrome ) ? 2 ) Assuming the complete set of closures is identified , does anything beyond nulling the variable need to be done to assure marking the DOM element for garbage collection ? 3 ) I have also noticed my list of arrays stored by the page is giant and contains references to DOM elements not being gathered by the GC . Is there a documented best practice for cleaning arrays from javascript and allowing all elements to be marked for deletion ? ( Note : this is a current prime suspect for the source of the memory leak )"

I mainly want to know this so that I can Google it and read more about it .

"For better accessibility we needed a second alternative set of play/pause controls and ( with the help of user Kento Nishi ) we successfully moved from DEMO A ( with only 1 audio playback control ) to DEMO B ( with duplicated audio playback controls ) .PROBLEM1 The time duration ( far right number ) is broken in DEMO B.PROBLEM2 Every webpage has its own folder . Some pages have a spoken audio file ready made , *.mp3 but some pages dont . Would it be possible to hide all audio controls html if the spoken.mp3 ( same file name for all pages ) is absent in the page 's own filder ? So in summary : if the *.mp3 file exists on the server in the current web page folder < source src= '' *.mp3 '' type= '' audio/mpeg '' > then display the html for the audio controls . Otherwise hide the audio html controls via CSS.The old DEMO A , with only 1 set of controls : The new DEMO B , with multiple set of controls : Here JS Lint shows errors : unexpected for and unexpected var , but I doubt wether these the reason behind the broken audio time duration.BEAUTY The good part about both demos A & B are that the audio file is loaded not until ( and only after ) a user clicks play . That way not wasting any bandwith untill user clicks play ! This functionality is important and should remain intact , as well as the duplicated set of controls layout-wise and the html parts should remain as much as possible intact.BOUNTY:200 The new demo works except the duration/audio length is broken and when audio file is not existing the controlls are shown . The bounty is a little token of appreciation for a solution to either problems ( or both ) in a working jsfiddle demo . Thanks for any and all help ."

"I want to better understand how objects in Ruby have access methods defined in classes and modules . Specifically , I want to compare and contrast it with JavaScript ( which I 'm more familiar with ) .In JavaScript , objects look up methods on the object itself and if it ca n't find it there , it 'll look for the method on the prototype object . This process will continue until reaching Object.prototype.In the JavaScript example , both obj1 and obj2 do n't have the someMethod function on the object itself . The key to note is that : There 's one copy of the someMethod function in the child object and both obj1 and obj2 delegate to the child object.What this means is that neither obj nor obj2 have copies of the someMethod function on the objects themselves.If the child object did n't have the someMethod function defined , then delegation would continue to the parent object.Now I want to contrast this with a similar example in Ruby : Here are my questions : Does obj1 and obj2 in the Ruby code each own a copy of the some_method method ? Or is it similar to JavaScript where both objects have access to some_method via another object ( in this case , via the Child class ) ? Similarly , when inheritance is taken into account in Ruby , does each Ruby object have a copy of all of the class and superclass methods of the same name ? My gut tells me that Ruby objects DO NOT have separate copies of the methods inherited from their class , mixed-in modules , and superclasses . Instead , my gut is that Ruby handles method lookup similarly to JavaScript , where objects check if the object itself has the method and if not , it looks up the method in the object 's class , mixed-in modules , and superclasses until the lookup reaches BasicObject ."
"I have two directories src and compiled . I would like to ensure one-way data synchronization from src to compiled with Grunt Watch . As an intermediary step , I would like to compile *.less files as well as a subset of *.js files which are written with ES6 syntax.I 've successfully written the tasks which do what I need : These tasks watch the appropriate files . The event handler dynamically modifies clean copy and babel tasks such that they work upon the files being added/changed/removed.However , I am watching several thousand files and the watch task takes a non-trivial amount of time to initialize . On my high-end development PC initialization takes 6+ seconds . This issue is exacerbated by the fact that the watch task reinitializes after every task.This means that if I have two files , fileA and fileB , and I modify fileA and save then there is a 6+ second period where watch fails to detect modifications to fileB . This results in de-synchronization between my two directories.I found this GitHub issue regarding my problem , but it is still open and unanswered : https : //github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch/issues/443The discussion on GitHub highlights that the issue may only occur when spawn : false has been set , but , according to the Grunt Watch documentation : If you need to dynamically modify your config , the spawn option must be disabled to keep the watch running under the same context.As such , I believe I need to continue using spawn : false.I have to assume this is a pretty standard procedure for Grunt tasks .

"In all of the JavaScript operator precedence charts I can find ( like this one and this one ) , the logical AND ( & & ) has slightly higher precedence to the logical OR ( || ) .I ca n't seem to figure out an expression where the result is different than it would be if they had the same precedence .

"Prepending that a solution only needs to work in the latest versions of Chrome , Firefox , and Safari as a bonus.-I am trying to use an associative array for a large data set with knockout . My first try made it a true associative array : but knockout was not happy with looping over that . So I tried a cheating way , hoping that : where the location in the array is the PK ID from the database table . This array is about 3.2k items large , and would be iterated over around every 10 seconds , hence the need for speed . I tried doing this with a splice , e.g.but splice does not create indices , so since my first PKID is 1 , it is still inserted at myArray [ 0 ] regardless . If my first PK was 500 , it would start at 0 still.My second thought is to initialize the array with var myArray = new Array ( maxSize ) but that seems heavy handed . I would love to be able to use some sort of map function to do this , but I 'm not really sure how to make the key value translate into an index value in javascript.My third thought was to keep two arrays , one for easy look up and the other to store the actual values . So it combines the first two solutions , almost , by finding the index of the object in the first example and doing a lookup with that in the second example . This seems to be how many people manage associative arrays in knockout , but with the array size and the fact that it 's a live updating app with a growing data set seems memory intensive and not easily manageable when new information is added.Also , maybe I 'm hitting the mark wrong here ? We 're putting these into the DOM via knockout and managing with a library called isotope , and as I mentioned it updates about every 10 seconds . That 's why I need the fast look up but knockout does n't want to play with my hash table attempts. -- clarity edits : so on initial load the whole array is loaded up ( which is where the new Array ( maxLength ) would go , then every 10 seconds anything that has changed is loaded back . That is the information I 'm trying to quickly update. -- knockout code : Then on updates the hope is :"

"Preface : I have a demo of the problem on my personal site ( I hope this is ok . If not , I can try to set it up on jsfiddle ) . I 'm intending this question to be a little fun , while also trying to understand the time functions take in javascript.I 'm incrementing the value of progress bars on a timeout . Ideally ( if functions run instantaneously ) they should fill at the same speed , but in the real world , they do not . The code is this : Naively , one would think should all run ( fill the progress bar ) at the same speed . However , in the first two bars , ( if we call `` setting the progress bar '' a single operation ) I 'm performing one operation every 500 ms for a total of 500 operations to fill the bar ; in the third , I 'm performing one operation every 50ms for a total of 5,000 operations to fill the bar ; in the fourth , I 'm performing one operation every 5ms for a total of 50,000 operations to fill the bar.What part of my code is takes the longest , causes these speed differences , and could be altered in order to make them appear to function in the way that they do ( the fourth bar gets smaller increments ) , but also run at the same speed ?"

I have an issue where I have a div class= '' tasteTheRainbow '' and inside are img tags . One tag in particular is a png class named .gA3.Now tasteTheRainbow already has a css background url but when you tap or click the .gA3 I want the background url to change.I have tried many other stackoverflow posts and found no solution.Here is my HTML and my CSS : As I mentioned above I have tried using CSS classname : active . I have also tried multiple java script solutions and they simply do not change the background url to image1 to image2 .
So my character div changes its background image when the player presses x which then kills the enemy if the character is touching the enemy . This image switch is to do a mock animation of swinging a sword.I used set timeout to delay switching the background image back to its original state . This works.HOWEVER theirs a bug where if I spam x there is no longer a delay between the images switching and I hypothesize the reason having something to do with stacking asynchronous callbacks from the setTimeout function that gets invoked when the player spams x . ** SET TIMEOUT INVOKED IN THIS FUNCTION **** REVERTS BACKGROUND IMAGE TO ORIGINAL **** LINK TO JS FIDDLE FULL PROJECT **https : //jsfiddle.net/mugs17/sud2ojxy/17/

"In my spelling game at the moment , the grid is designed for 3 letter words . I can add bigger words into the `` wordList '' ( which creates the grid dynamically ) , but the size of the grid changes and overlaps on the rows where the bigger words are.At the moment when a four letter word is added for example , the grid will add an extra cell to the end of that row rather than judging that the word will not fit on that line and take another position in the grid that works.Basically I need the grid to stay the same size , and when words are randomly placed , determine a position that allows the grid to stay 6x6 rather than going out the edges when they do not fit in position . Obviously when words bigger than 6 letters are added this will not work , because it is a 6x6 , but this should n't be a problem as I do not think we will stretch to words that big.Words are added through the html like this ...

"I use jQuery to intentionally remove css classes from elements in a potentially large html table . See below for an explanation why I am doing that.Currently I am doing it like this : The table sometimes is large and has many elements . I would like to speed up the page load / DOM manipulation.The IE 's built-in Javascript profiler tells me that especially the .addBack ( ) is slow . It seems to do some kind of sorting , which is totally unnecessary to my use case . Could I get rid of that ? Is there another way to include the selected element itself , besides addBack ( ) ? IE javascript profiler : Execution time for a collection of about 60000 elements . The inclusive times are in the third columnOr is there another , more efficient way to remove classes from a large set of elements , with selecting an element , itself , and all children ?

If I put a debugger on that line and step through the code , it works fine and the element fades out and gets hidden . Call it a Heisenbug.My question is not about the race condition per se . I want to know how it is possible for this to happen given the nature of the JavaScript runtime .

"I 'm fairly new to Javascript ( just finished the book Eloquent Javascript ) , and am currently reading AngularJS from O'Reilly .

Putting the ' $ ' back in allowed the code to work . Here was my reasoning for initially leaving it out : Oh , ' $ scope ' is just a variable name local to the function . Like any other programming language such as Java or C++ , because this parameter is just a local variable , I can name it whatever I want since whatever argument gets passed into the function will just get passed by value .

"I have an example of my current work here : https : //jsfiddle.net/pv5xroLc/My problem is that when the table in my example is fully scrolled to the right , the faded gradient still covers part of my table even though it can not be scrolled further , thus it makes the last column harder to read . I am wondering what the best solution to hiding this gradient is while still making it clear that the table can be scrolled horizontally ( this is going to appear on mobile ) .Currently , my html structure is as follows : The .fader element has an : :after pseudo-element which contains the `` fader '' on it , which is an absolutely positioned element with the linear-gradient I 'm using to indicate that the element can be scrolled horizontally . The .scrollable element is a horizontally scrolling element that holds my table.I currently have two solutions I have considered : Add a listener to check when the scrollbar has reached the right side ( like this example ) , then hide or fade out the gradient . The problem with this is that I have more than one of these faded tables on the page , and I 'm not sure what the most effective way to setup these listeners would be . I 'm using Vue.js with this , so I 'm not sure if this could/should be a directive or just a listener set on the page for each of these tables.Add some blank space to the right of the table , so you could scroll a little bit past the end of the actual table and the gradient would just blend into the background . I 've tried adding padding and margins to both the table and the .scrollable element but it does not add any extra space after the table.If anyone has suggestions for what they think I should do , it would be greatly appreciated ."

I think adding a new method to the model could get out of hand quickly if I have a lot of specific requirements for queries , however if I filter down the full-set of data in the controller , that seems inefficient as I am retrieving all of the data from the database initially , when I am just going to disregard the majority of it.Possibly I am completely off the mark and both of these approaches would be incorrect.EditThis is to offer additional clarity.I can achieve the desired output my adding the following pieces of code to my model and routes : This does n't feel like a very clean way to do it though , and I feel like I am breaking some CRUD conventions with the addition of the new route and the way it is named / accessed.I know SQL and ideally I would like to avoid an ORM seeing as I am still learning Node ."

"Inspired by preact 's `` no build tools route '' , I recently created a project with no build or bundling process . Conceptually , it looks like this ( pseudo code following ) .I have a dependency on react-button which uses e.g . microbundle to resolve the preact import through the node_modules folder.Then , there 's my app which requires preact-button as a dependency . It 's just a .html file for now.However , my app is not using any bundler and hence imports preact-button 's code . If I had a bundler , this would n't be a problem , as the import ... from `` preact '' would be resolved through the bundler . But now , taking advantage of the type= '' module '' syntax , this global module name can not be imported anymore . Instead , an error is thrown : As the author of preact-button , what I want though is that my module : can be used with a bundler ( as shown above ) can be used within a JavaScript module by somehow resolving it 's dependencies ( dynamically ? ) Since preact advertises this approach on their website , I took a quick look into their build process . They have a simple advantage , which is that they do n't have to deal with any kind of dependencies ( e.g . peer or regular ) , as they simply do n't have any.But is it possible to mix bundled modules and JavaScript modules without any heavy build process ? Is there maybe even a commonly agreed upon approach ?"

"I have a very weird session issue - some odd cross session problem that has me baffled.Basically I have an express 3 app in which I have 2 , seemingly unrelated things - one is a standard contact form that someone can use to email me and the other is an API call to mailchimp to add subscribers when they place an order . These are 2 completely different calls/actions.At the top of my contact form I have a check for the variable 'error ' which I can use in my controller code to say something such as `` invalid email '' or other error message . My contact form has 2 controller actions - one for GET which shows the form and one for POST which submits and shows errors if any.The issue is this - when I load the contact form initially I see this message : `` Error : someone @ example.com is already subscribed to list General . Click here to update your profile . '' which is a MailChimp message - not only unrelated to the process but unrelated to my session ! This error can happen if a returning customer places and order and they are already subscribed . I do n't ever show them this message not , as far as I can tell , actually store it . So I am confused.One thing to note is that the order part is called from the node server upon receiving an xml file from the payment gateway ( so not a regular session user ) - so maybe there are some session internals I am not understanding.The code is below but here 's a summary of the issue . A node server , without a user session active , is making an API call to mailchimp to add a subscriber using this module - It is common that the same email will be subscribed twice so mailchimp will reply with an `` already subscribed '' message which I *do no*t store or load in Express 's error locals . Then a user visits the site , goes to contact form which checks if there are any error messages from that user trying to submit the form with say missing fields - and they see the mailchimp message showing another person 's email address . Here 's the relevant code.app.js : contact form controller : contact form : order form controller ( called by payment gateway api on successful order - never called directly by user )"

"I have two select controls.One is dependent on the other . For a simple example , let 's assume the first displays a list of cities , while the other displays a list of streets in each city.When the page initially loads , the select control displaying the streets is showing all the available streets . However , once the user chooses a city in the first select , the second select is filtered to display streets belonging to the selected city only.This works OK when using the options binding , however , I need the ability to generate optgroups and options binding does not support it , so I have to use the foreach binding.The result is that whenever a city is selected , two unintended consequences occur : The second select ( the filtered list of streets ) appear to have the first street of the selected city chosen , even though I 'm using valueAllowUnset : true . This is not reflected in the view modelWhen actually choosing a street in the second select and then choosing a different city in the first select , the second select updates properly to reflect the changes in the list , but the view model does not , thereby still retaining the previously selected value ( even though it 's not in the list anymore ) .

I do n't have a name for it , so it makes it that much more difficult.Looking at libraries such as Folktale and monet.js , I like being able to chain operations with map without null-checking or if statements , using e.g . Maybe , Either , Task.I am wondering whether a similar construct exists to solve the following problem : I have an initial input.I want to construct a chain of functions that operate on the input.Each function may or may not return a result.If a function does not return a result , call the next function in the chain.As soon as a function returns a result , ignore the rest of the functions in the chain ( similarly to mapping a function on a Maybe.Nothing ) Return the result.In other words , I 'm looking for something similar to Maybe which holds a value and maps a function on Just but ignores a function mapped on Nothing , and you can extract the value . I 'm looking for something that holds an input and an initial null result . When you map a function , it runs the function on the input only if result is null . If the function returns a value , that becomes the result and any other functions that are mapped are ignored . Finally , you can extract the result.In imperative programming , this might look like : Instead , I 'd like to construct something along the lines oforDoes such a construct exist ? Does it have a name ? Even if this does n't exist and I could write it myself , I 'm at a loss as to what to call it . Suggestions welcome.Thanks for your help !

"I am using Angular-Messages with Angular-Material v1.0.9 . I have an md-dialog inside which I have a form with fields created with ng-repeat : Angular-Messages are used to display form errors . The problem is that when I use both required and pattern messages , they are sometimes shown and sometimes not . It worked properly when there was no regexp check . The scenario is for example : I have a field which needs to be a number . I enter wrong value , e.g . a text - error message is displayed.I delete value from field so that it 's empty . Now required error should be displayed , but it is not . There is a red border informing about the error , though.Now I enter a correct value , e.g . 10 - there is no message as expected.Again , I enter wrong value - now error is displayed.The above scenario can be repeated and is always true - I need to enter a correct value before error is displayed again.I 've found one workaround which is to add md-auto-hide to container with ng-messages , but now errors are displayed even just after opening the modal window which is not what I want .

"Let 's say I want to detect support for notifications ( http : //notifications.spec.whatwg.org/ ) in a JavaScript library.I can use window.Notification ! == undefined . But what if the users of the library ( or another library ) also have some kind of global Notification object defined for completely different purpose ? On the other hand , what if the other library is a polyfill ? Then their Notification object is acceptable . Should I test for all methods in addition to testing for the global object ? Update : I have noticed an interesting thing in one notifications polyfill : How reliable is relying on something like that to detect whether it is a native/polyfill object ?"
"JavaScript only has function scope . Thus , variables declared in for loops are visible for the entire function.For example , When we have multiple for-loops , this opens the question of how we handle the variables in these other for loops.Do we use a different variable ? Or do we use the same variable but just assign a value ( instead of declaring it ) ? Or declare i outside of the loops ? Or redeclare i ? All of these work ( or at least they do on the latest versions of my browsers ) . JSHint does n't like the last approach , though.Is there an approach which is most idiomatic or otherwise preferable ?"

"I noticed in some legacy code the following pattern : After some research , this appears to be a very old technique for hiding the contents of script elements from the DOM when the browser did not support the < script > element . More information can be found here . My concern is this : why does < ! -- not throw a Syntax Error ? I 've found on whatwg.org 's website that < ! -- should be functionally equivalent to // , and it links off to a snippet from the ECMAScript grammar about comments . The problem is , < ! -- is n't defined by that grammar at all.So this seems like undefined behavior that happens to be implemented by all major browsers . Is there a specification that allows for this , or is this a backwards-compatibility hack that people are bringing forward ?"

"I 've been learning new features of React 16.8 .

Now , the third test tries to set the state of text with the same string value , but the reference is different . I expect nothing to be re-rendered , but actually , the < Headline/ > will be re-rendered.Shall I use certain memorize technique to avoid ? I feel it will be too much code to archive that .

"I 'm developing a reward system for our VLE which uses three separate technologies - JavaScript for most of the client-side/display processing , PHP to communicate with the database and MySQL for the database itself.I 've attached three screenshots of my `` transactions '' table . Its structure , a few example records and an overview of its details.The premise is that members of staff award points to students for good behaviour etc . This can mean that classes of 30 students are given points at a single time . Staff have a limit of 300 points/week and there are around 85 staff currently accessing the system ( this may rise ) .The way I 'm doing it at the moment , every `` transaction '' has a `` Giver_ID '' ( the member of staff awarding points ) , a `` Recipient_ID '' ( the student receiving the points ) , a category and a reason . This way , every time a member of staff issues 30 points , I 'm putting 30 rows into the database.This seemed to work early on , but within three weeks I already have over 12,000 transactions in the database.At this point it gets a bit more complicated . On the Assign Points page ( another screenshot attached ) , when a teacher clicks into one of their classes or searches for an individual student , I want the students ' points to be displayed . The only way I can currently do this on my system is to do a `` SELECT * FROM 'transactions ' '' and put all the information into an array using the following JS : When logging in to the system internally , this appears to work quickly enough . When logging in externally however , this process takes around 20 seconds , and thus does n't display the students ' points values until you 've clicked/searched a few times.I 'm using the following code in my PHP to access these transactions : So , my question is , how should I actually be approaching this ? Full-text indices ; maybe a student table with their total points values which gets updated every time a transaction is entered ; mass-transactions ( i.e . more than one student receiving the same points for the same category ) grouped into a single database row ? These are all things I 've contemplated but I 'd love someone with more DB knowledge than myself to provide enlightenment.Example recordsTable structureTable overviewAssign Points interfaceMany thanks in advance ."

"How do I know what traverses the DOM and what does n't ? It seems like this returns all the div elements AND THEN does another scan for P elements on each dom element that was returned in the first div search.The class ones do n't seem to scan the dom . They only filter the previous list $ ( 'div ' ) for elements that contain classes foo . If a child of $ ( 'div ' ) has class foo it is not selected.Does n't contain dupes . So it seems to be scanning only once with a list of lambdas that either compare or they do n't . But this gets really really confusing when you have filters like : contains ( ' x ' ) which seem like they can recurse the dom on their very own.So how do these selectors work ? Does 'div .foo ' traverse for only divs first and then do a filter for classes that contain foo , or does it somehow get turned into a computation that says when tag==Div & & class==foo . What about when there 's multiple selectors ? They show up in the order they appeared on the page without dupes making me feel like it only scanned the dom once . Maybe it just sorts and removes dupes before returning ?"

"Using bracket notation , you can initialize an array with zero or more values : Using new Array ( ) , you can initialize an array with zero or two or more values : Referring to the multiple-parameter syntax , in JavaScript : The Definitive Guide , Flanagan writes : Using an array literal is almost always simpler than this usage of the Array ( ) constructor.He does n't provide any examples in which the multiple-parameter syntax is simpler , and I ca n't think of any .

I am trying to debug a problem in my app which I have narrowed down to a particular situation involving a regular expression which causes Chrome to choke ! Trying the same code in Firefox works fine . Also if I reduce my 'sample ' text to run the regex on it works too . So what gives ? Here is the jsfiddle : http : //jsfiddle.net/XWKRb/1/ ( Which will fail to initialize at all because Chrome would choke if you are getting the same result as I am ) The code I have put in the jsfiddle is : Maybe there is a better way to write my regular expression to avoid the issue ? The goal is the regular expression should catch a string of numbers which are separated by comma or semi-colon .
I have no idea what is happening here . The code is : I would expect this to log in the console : But instead it logs : How is the second named function being created when the code does n't enter that branch ?

"After years of creating applications using prototypal inheritance in JavaScript , I 've started to explore using parasitic inheritance . Despite its primary pitfall - at least to me - of potentially creating several copies of methods in memory as you create an object hierarchy , I 'm finding that it really resonates with me with its simplicity and the fact that `` new '' is rendered unnecessary . However , I 'm stuck on what happens with `` this . '' Most of the examples I 've seen online only scratch the surface showing how to implement parasitic inheritance like so : As I asked in the comment in the bar ( ) object , does `` this '' refer to bar ( ) or is the scope of this relegated to method2 ?

I already processed the arr array and I do n't want to process pointer array to reflect the new data , which I already know where it is.The Nina Scholz answer seems to solve the problem.Is there a way to use `` pointers '' like C in Javascript ? What I want to do is : I have an array with objectsAnd I want to have an array to point to the positions of this arrayThis will get a reference to the { prop : 3 } and { prop : 4 } objects , which is not what I want , because , if I do : As you can see , pointer holds a reference to the objects { prop:3 } and { prop:4 } .How can I achieve pointer to hold reference to the position 0 of the array , instead of the object stored in it ? So , on this example , pointer = > [ { prop:1 } , { prop:3 } ] ? I ca n't call pointer = [ arr [ 0 ] , arr [ 1 ] ] all the time because arr will change constantly and asynchronously.Is there a `` reactive '' way to handle arrays ?"

"I 'm not new to JavaScript , but I never could understand a certain thing about its prototypal inheritance.Say we have Parent and Child `` classes '' ( functions Parent and Child that create objects ) . To be able to create Children , we first need toHere is the difficulty : by assigning the prototype to Child , we get one more object Parent that does n't do anything in our code , just shares its properties with Children . But the constructor of Parent is still called ! If parent represents , for example , a certain UI object , then in our application we will have one more such object which we actually did n't wish to create ! And that , of course , may and will affect the state of our application.I see a way to cope with this : to pass certain arguments to Parent constructor indicating that the object we are creating is just for prototype , not for general use , like : and then in Parent constructor decide whether to do any displayable stuff or not . But this is such an ugly workaround ! In class-oriented languages , e.g . Java , we do n't have such issue at all because inheriting does n't suppose calling any additional functions . What should I do to not use such ugly techniques in my programs and still be able to create a nice-looking prototype hierarchy ?"

"Recently I started learning JavaScript through Nicholas C. Zakas ' book Professional JavaScript For Web Developers and I came across some questions that I could not solve by myself.As the title says , that 's all about named arguments and arguments object in JavaScript functions.E.g . we have this piece of code : The book says that values in the arguments object are automatically reflected by the corresponding named arguments , so num2 enters the function with a value of 20 and then it gets overwritten via arguments [ 1 ] and finally gets a value of 10.All good all clear up to this point . Then it says that this effect goes only one way : changing the named argument does not result in a change to the corresponding value in arguments.And that 's where the problems start.I tried to modify this code a bit to understand what the author says but I failed.E.g.This time num2 enters function with a value of 20 again , it changes to 10 via arguments [ 1 ] and then it changes once more to 40 via the named argument num2 this time . Alert pops up 50 , since a change to a named argument does not result in a change to the corresponding value in arguments . Why does alert not pop up 20 ?"

The scope is used to define local variables as in the following example : In both scopes this refers to the global context ( typically , window ) , since the function has not been called on any object . What I am interested in , though , is the 'scope object ' , i.e , the object where variables within a scope are defined on .

"I think I am missing very important thing about javascriptIn the scenario above I have defined an object 'obj ' and created a method 'test ' for this object .

Then I am calling 'test ( ) ' , unsubscribing 'click ' event from the button and calling 'test ( ) ' once again .

So when I have dettached all the events referencing the first 'obj.test ( ) ' . In this case I guess it 's only 'click ' event .

"my question is actually one of understanding - I have a working solution , I just do n't understand how it works.Okay , so - what I 'm trying to do is adding a setTimeout in a loop , and passing a changing value through it . Example : If I understood correctly , this doesnt work because Javascript does not ( like PHP ) pass the value of i to the function , but passes a reference of i - which in turn is not static , but continues to change with the counter.I found a solution , which goes like this : I do n't really understand what this actually does . It looks like it passes a the `` alert '' function back to the calling function , but I ca n't make any sense of that.I can work with this solution and also adapt it to other contexts , but I 'd really like to understand all of my code , not just use stuff I found somewhere and be happy it works .

"I 'm using heap snapshots to debug a potential memory issue . As the documentation indicates objects are shown in this format : Where NumericIdentifier is : This is an object ID . Displaying an object 's address makes no sense , as objects are moved during garbage collections . Those object IDs are real IDs — that means , they persist among multiple snapshots taken . This allows precise comparison between heap states . Maintaining those IDs adds an overhead to GC cycles , but it is only initiated after the first heap snapshot was taken — no overhead if heap profiles are n't used.I 'm wondering if the identifiers are guaranteed to be monotonically increasing ? That is given : Can I rely on the first object to be older ( was allocated before ) than the second one ? If yes - how strong is the guarantee ?

"EDIT : My function was broken , with the /n in it . Thanks woofmeow for leading me to question my function ! I am new to programming . I have been trying my best and I have learned a lot the past few months ( a bunch here ! ) but I am stumped .

It used to run , then I changed some things and did n't save the changes , I 'm not sure what I did . I know , I know , rookie mistake ( I learned from it ! ) . The Javascript shows up fine on view page source but does n't run anymore.Here is the page source , maybe it is that simple : Here is the PHP : The show_users script sends this into the viewer : The PHP in the HTML was NOT changed from when it was working : And finally , the viewing script that gives us our page source ( Note : $ embedded_javascript is $ delete_user_script ) : When I mouse over the image to delete the user , it still shows the correct script link ( `` Javascript : delete_user ( % d ) '' , where % d is the user_id ) but it 's like the function is n't defined anymore , nothing happens .

"While running through the starter tutorial on EmberJS ' site , a few things have me a little confused now.One thing to note immediately is that I decided to use the ember 1.9.0beta4 with handlebars 2.0.0 instead of 1.8.1 / 1.3.0 included in the starter pack.First the code included in the screencast : andThis works exactly as expected and the requested post appears when clicked.However , because I 'm using 1.9.0 , the preceding code produces a deprecated warning for { { # each } } , telling me to use { { # each foo in bar } } instead .

I then try to change the code to : Great ! The title and author 's name once again appear for each post . But clicking either post gives me an undefined id . I change { { # link-to 'post ' this } } to { { # link-to 'post ' this.id } } . Same result . I change it to { { # link-to 'post ' post.id } } . The id is now included but when I click the link I get this error : My questions are : What happens internally that forces the post . prefix if I simply include the post in code ?

"I have a global service widgetService which holds data for a number of widgets , each identified by a widgetID . Each widget 's data can change at any time .

By react 's recommendation , this should be handled by setting the state based on properties using the static getDerivedStateFromProps function .

"My web application collects data with : id ( key value ) timestampvalueThen , it creates an HTML table like this : Explanation : It sorts the timestamp value in DESC order.If , for example , t1 is the timestamp for ID1 and 't2 ' is the timestamp for ID2 , and ... t1 + 2 seconds > = t2the ID2 row becomes red.In my example : ID1 is red ( # FFA9A9 ) cause of ID2 ( same value and timestamp between 2 sec ) ID3 is red cause of ID5 that is red cause of ID6.ID8 is red cause of ID9in that case ID1 is a copy and ID2 is original ; ID3 and ID5 are a copy and ID6 is the original ; ID8 is a copy and ID9 is it 's original.I 've got to count the red copy and put the counter in another cell of the row that is the original.The result of my example should be : I need it because i 've got 3 data collector and i need to understand which event is the same one repeated ... If the value is the same and the timestamp are between 2 sec it is the same event and i need to take only the older one in table but i need also show that exists other captured copy of it ...

I am displaying every word in a sentence in separate div using inline-block with max-width of 120px . When I try to increase the font size on parent div my inline-block of div get overlaps due to large font size . Is there any way to programmatically calculate the max-width required for inline-block of div to be used after increasing the font size ? Here is sample code snippet : Keep pressing the + button and at certain stage you will find that the div is overlapping each other . I want to fix this with calculation for my max-width to attain the exact ratio according to initial size 120px after incrementing font-size .

"I have a bunch of divs that have a content div inside of them . In the content div are 3 elements , an h1 , a p and a span , all left-aligned . What I want to happen is the following : The content div should be vertically and horizontally centeredThe content div should be exactly as wide as the text in the h1 or the text in the span ( whichever is longer ) , if above the max-width these should wrapThe p should be 75 % as wide as the content div but not have an impact on the content div 's size ( effectively being 75 % as wide as the h1 or span , whichever is longer ) However I 'm running into the following problems : Problem 1 : Having a long p element causes the content div to expand to its max-width no matter the size of the h1 or span . I 've tried using absolute positioning to fix this but it disrupts the vertical centering of the divProblem 2 : Having a long h1 element leaves a gap where the word breaks over 2 lines making the content div not appear centeredSee the code snippet below to clarify what I 'm after and what 's going wrong , the borders are just to help visualise what 's happening.Has anyone got an idea of how this is possible ? I would like to stick to CSS as these need to be responsive , although if there is a simple JS/jQuery solution it would be considered.EDIT : To clarify the visual effect I am after here 's a run-down of why the examples are good or bad . I 've also added the ability to remove borders to demonstrate what I mean by something being visually centred:1 ) Good : Content div fits to width of h1 , looks centered without the borders as equal space to left and right of h12 ) Good : Content div fits to width of span as it 's longer than the h1 , looks centered without the borders as equal space to left and right of spanProblem 1:3 ) Bad : p is expanding the width of the content div , looks shifted to the left without borders as more space on right than left . If the p did not expand the div and stayed at 75 % of the width this would not happen4 ) Improvement on 3 but still bad : Potential fix found in various SO questions showing absolute positioning stops the p expanding the content div , but now that it is not part of the flow it messes up the vertical centeringProblem 2:5 ) Bad : The problem here is the h1 element , because it is now longer than the max-width it splits into 2 lines . But the extra space between the end of the first line and the max-width of the div is kept so when removing borders it does n't look centered because there is more space to the right than the left of the h16 ) Fixes 5 but not a solution : Manually breaking the line ( using a < br > ) achieves the look I need , because the h1 is n't expanded to the max-width so looks centered without the borders . This is n't feasible in the real application though because the divs can vary in widthAlternative JSFiddle Link"

"For my application in node.js I must sort elements of an array in descending order based on some numeric value ( i.e . a numeric rank ) . Since my application is performance-critical , I decided to build my data structure so that sorting is optimized . I hypothesized that the fewer data contained per element in my array , the faster the sorts will be . To test my hypothesis , I ran the following on three different arrays of length 10000 : EDIT : Guys , it seems as though there was something flawed with my original testing . The first test takes significantly longer than the ones that follow . As such , I have modified my test code to have a 'buffer ' sort before the actual sorts . Furthermore , I rotated the order of my tests for a fixed number of trials to reduce any bias that might result from the ordering of the tests themselves . I 've modified the results accordingly.Full source here : https : //raw.githubusercontent.com/youngrrrr/js-array-sort-bench-test/master/arraySortTest.js Old test : After 25 trials ( I know , small sample size but I did this all manually ) I got the following times for average sort time : sparseArray : ( 24 + 23 + 21 + 23 + 21 + 22 + 22 + 22 + 22 + 22 + 21 + 20 + 22 + 24 + 24 + 21 + 22 + 22 + 25 + 23 + 24 + 23 + 21 + 21 + 23 ) / 25 = 22.32mssparseArray2 : ( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 5 ) / 25 = 4.56msdenseArray : ( 5 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 ) / 25 = 4.88ms New test : After 25 trials ( I know , small sample size but I did this all manually ) I got the following times for average sort time : sparseArray : ( 4+4+4+4+3+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+3+4+4 ) /15 = 3.867mssparseArray2 : ( 4+4+4+6+5+4+4+4+4+5+5+4+5+5+5 ) /15 = 4.533msdenseArray : ( 4+4+4+5+5+4+4+4+4+5+5+4+5+5+5 ) /15 = 4.466msSo I 've come to the following conclusions : Arrays of numbers sort faster than arrays of objects whose values are numbers . This makes sense intuitively.For some reason , and paradoxically so , more data in a particular element results in faster sorting than less data ( as evidenced by sparseArray2 vs denseArray runtimes ) .What I want to know is : Are these conclusions backed by any documentation/something other than my testing ? That is , did I reach the correct conclusions ? And why ? Why do arrays of numbers sort faster than arrays of objects ( makes sense intuitively , but what 's the explanation behind this , if any ) ? Not only this , but why do arrays containing MORE data seem to sort faster than those containing less data ? And note , I 'm not married to these conclusions or anything . The sample size is small and my testing has proven to be flawed before , so my results may very well just be the result of bad testing . Also , there seem to be various factors that I have no awareness about that could be affecting the results ( as Ryan O'Hara pointed out in my earlier post ) . The point of this post is to discover any fact-based explanation for sorting behavior in Javascript.Thanks for reading !"

"I 'm implementing a small voting system on my website . I came up with three implementation methods that I would like your feedback on . I want to give my users the ability to cast several types of votes on some user generated content . It 's micro Q & A about games , not unlike SO 's and their vote system , on a much smaller and specialized scale.After toying with the following methods I ca n't decide which is best.Method 1 : Uses URL params and formsMethod 2 : Uses URL params and jQueryMethod 3 : Uses ether one of the above , but retrieves its info from the databaseThe schema assumes both Q 's and A 's are a post object with a different postTypeId , and the following two tables : parentId represents the id of the parent post . If the post being voted on is an answer post , it is used to ensure a question post ( postTypeId=1 ) can have only one accepted answer . ownerUserId represents the userId of the post 's ( being vote on ) owner . It is compared against the userId , which comes from the session , to ensure a user ca n't vote on his or her own posts . userId comes from the session and represents the person casting the vote . Method 1 Create a vote form in the view as the query loops over each post . Use hidden fields to capture the data : The postId , parentId , and ownerUserId will come from the query being output to the view . The userId will come from the session . Disadvantages:1 . Users can manipulate data . A user can accept an answer to a question he did not ask since ownerUserId is set at the view level.2 . Cumbersome : I would have to create as many forms as there are posts in the view . Each post will have 4 forms . A page with 10 posts can have 40 forms . Advantages:1 . It 's simple.Method 2 Use anchors with custom data tags and jQuery to construct the vote URL . The ownerUserId , postId , parentId , voteTypeId will come from the URL . The userId from the session.Advantages 1 . Light weight and no forms . One jQuery call to submit any vote , as such : var data = 'voteTypeId= ' $ ( this ) .data ( `` vote-type-id '' ) etc . Submitted over ajax ! Disadvantages : 1 . JS disabled = no vote . 2 . Data can be manipulated since it 's being sent through the URL . Method 3 Submit only the voteTypeId and the postId over URL , using either methods 1 or 2 . Use the postId to query the db and verify the post object being voted on exists . This way I can also verify the ownerUserId and parentId of the post . If the post is an object , create a newVote object . The userId will come from the session . The postId and voteTypeId will come from the URL . The parentId and ownerUserId will come from the post object I queried for . Advantages : 1 . Data shielded from user manipulation as the presence of the post can be verified , and so can be it 's ownerUserId and parentId.Disadvantages : 1 . Laborious . Asking the database to find the post and retrieve details already available at the view level seems unnecessary . 2 . The data is denormalized in some instances , so after a successful vote ( an up vote , for example ) I have to increment the posts table via object callbacks ( add +1 to the existing number of up votes , for example ) , which is yet another call to the database with information that was already available at the view , and then the controller levels.Other things I have not considered : 1 . Finding if a vote already exists and toggling it , which will require yet another query . 2 . Validation combinations are a nightmare.I 'm looking for feedback or additional ideas . So please share ! Many thanks !"

"After much Googling , I can not find a clear example how to avoid programming every catch to ascertain if a Promise rejection error is programmatic or operational .

If I wanted to return to the user the fact that their email is not found , I ca n't just use the message , because I might accidentally return a reference error message . ( Awkward ! ) However , compare with the the sql.query pattern and it is very clear that the error is operational , because blarg=1 would bubble up to higher levels were it not in a promise.I see very little documentation on what the reject value should be , and how to differentiate . I 've considered using resolve ( new Error ( ) ) so that my success fulfillment function determines if there was an operational error and .catch is saved for programmatic errors , but that 's just silly.There 's a lot of bad info out there because it often references bluebird , Q , A+ and ES6 over the past 7 years ... hard to find examples for ES6 Node/7/9 ...

"While doing a code review of some Javascript files , my code review tool was showing `` � '' ( missing character symbol ) in one of the files . Upon further investigation , it turned out that the developer had used non-breaking spaces in their code . ( Probably a result of copy/pasting from web . ) To my surprise , this works fine in Chrome , IE11 , and Edge . But I 'm concerned that it would n't work in all browsers . Is this a required feature of Javascript language that I can rely on ? Or is this something I need to tell the developer to fix to avoid potential issues on other browsers ? Here is an example :"

"I 'm not having a problem , not trying to fix anything . I 'm just curious why Javascript works this way . I 've poked around with google , but `` js function no name '' gets a lot of hits about how to define and use anonymous functions ( not what I 'm looking for ) .

If I declare an object with a function inside like this : The apple ( ) function gets a name . That is , console.log ( objectOne.apple.name ) displays `` apple '' .But if I declare an object with a function inside like this : Then banana ( ) does n't get a name . That is , console.log ( objectTwo.banana.name ) displays nothing . Same for the following , and similar permutations.I can name the functions explicitly , of course , but again , I 'm not trying to fix anything , I just wonder why the two syntaxes produce different results . I 've always thought of them as functionally interchangeable.I notice that both of these forms , not inside an object , get names automatically : Why is the object.property = function ( ) { } form treated differently from the other forms ?"

"The following code ...

The fix is to wrap the yield wait ( ) in a parentheses.This error happens at parse time rather than at execution time ; so , my first assumption is that this is because there 's a syntactic ambiguity here . I looked at the yield keyword which defines it as : yield takes an expression and returns a value . This does not happen without the || ( OR ) operator as const value = yield else ( ) ; ; so , I looked at operator precedence . The || ( OR ) operator is evaluated at 5 before the yield operator at 2 . The precedence looks fine.It looks like the || ( OR ) operator requires an expression on either side and while I assume that yield [ expression ] is an expression , perhaps that 's not true ? Why is it that I need to wrap that part in parentheses to make it explicitly an expression ? What could || yield be ambiguous with ? I 'm sure I 'm just missing it ; or , is there some sneaky/deeper reason for this ? This question was also notoriously difficult to search for , so hopefully I 'm not duping here .

"I feel this should be answered somewhere in the internet but I failed to find it , maybe because I 'm not searching the correct terms but this is the problem : I have the following function : I was getting errors in succesFunction ( data , k , Parameters ) because ' k ' was always evaluated with the latest value . What is happening is that , when the for loop runs k is correctly increased but , when the callback function successFunction was executed , typically several ms after the loop was finished , it was always been evaluated with the last value of k , not the value of the loop the $ .ajax was called.I fixed this by creating another function that contains the ajax call . It looks like this : and it works . I think when the function is called in the parentFunction a copy of the value of the arguments is created and when the callback executes sees this value instead of the variable k which by the time would have a wrong value .

I have seen a few similar to what I am looking for but not exactly the same.So what I am trying to do is move elements from within one parent div to another but only once the user has scrolled a certain amount down the page . So once the user has reached a point on the page the elements will then move to another and then fade in at the very top of the page.So far I have been able to create the div element and get this to show at the top of the page but only once the user has scrolled down 600 . What I now need to do is once this element appears to move other div elements on the page to appear within it . Not sure if I am explaining this very well or not ! So if you look at the code below what I want to do now is to move all of the div class `` Test '' to move within the element of `` Top '' once the user has scrolled down and this appears . And then if the user scrolls back up again the `` Top '' element disappears and the `` Test '' div goes back to it 's normal place .
"An AngularJS app needs to re-use multiple custom objects . I am concerned about creating cluttered , redundant code that is hard to maintain , so I moved re-usable code to a service that can be concisely injected in the controller for each view and then called directly from each html view without cluttering the controllers with redundant code . The following image illustrates how the service someclass.js will be re-used , and thus why it is important to isolate as much of its code as possible in one place : I have developed code that partially accomplishes this on my devbox , and I have posted the code to a plnkr . ( Thank you to @ shakir for getting this plnkr to recreate the problem . ) I am also including the code below . Though clicking a form submit button does cause the form 's handler method in the service to be called , the problem is that the object that should contain the form 's data is undefined in the someclass.method1 ( ) method that should handle the form 's data . What specific changes need to be made to the code below so that the value of the user-submitted data from the form can be manipulated inside the service 's form handling method ? The complete requirements for communication between the view and the service ( through the controller ) are : 1 . ) someclass.prop1 can have its value printed in the view ( this works in the code below ) , and 2 . ) the ng-submit of confirmForm can directly call someclass.method1 as a handler and thus minimize the code in someroute.js ( this happens in the code below , but the object that should contain the form 's data is not defined when someclass.somemethod1 ( ) is running ) plnkr code : Here is the plnkr with the call to the service suggested by @ JoaozitoPolo . The current version is able to call the someclass.method1 ( ) from the view , but the form data is not passed into the function . So we need to figure out how to pass the form data into the function . CODE SHOWN HERE ALSO : The code that ( on my devbox ) connects the properties and methods of someview.html with someclass.js ( but does not send the data from the form into someclass.js during the function call ) is included as follows below : Here is the code for someclass.js : Here is the code for someroute.js : Here is someroute.html : Here is someroute_start.html , which includes the form that needs to be handled by someclass.js : For completeness , I am including someroute_first.html , which is as simple as : And someroute_second.html , which is as simple as : The main controller for the app is hello.js , which I am including here in case part of the solution includes initializing someclass : For completelness , index.html loads the modules as follows : Again , all of the above code is included in a bare minimum excerpt of code required to reproduce the problem at this plnkr .

I have some ideas with multiple loops , but to me it seems a bit too complex my solution.Update : my question is not the same as the one candidate for duplication because I do n't use lodash , and my object has to be refactored a bit , not just regrouped.Possible solution ( inspired by @ Gael 's answer )"

Before answering my question , please consider my argument : I understand the concept of recursion and how it leads to a stack overflow if there 's no stopping condition . But my argument here is that once the first f ( ) ; is executed , it will return a Promise and it exits the stack so this recursion should not face any stack overflow ever .

"I do n't know too much about the JavaScript garbage collector , just that it attempts to manage references so that unreferenced objects can be periodically purged from memory . I was thinking about something that I thought might improve performance if it was feasible by the language implementers.It would go something like this . In a file add a line : This is similar to the use strict setting . It would mark everything defined in the file as not for garbage collection . I 'm thinking this would be used in libraries like jQuery and underscore . All of the helper methods would be marked and stored in a separate area of memory that is not managed by the GC.While I know this might end up keeping around stuff that is not ever used ; it would at least isolate it from periodic GC process . So while we perhaps gobble up some extra memory , we at least lighten the load of GC processing.I apologize for the naivety of this suggestion as I have never implemented GC .

This may be completely stupid but given I type this into my browser console : What is the arr ; syntax doing behind the scenes ? I 'm assuming console.log ( arr ) ; is iterating all the properties of the arr object but what is arr ; doing ? Also does [ ] tell me I 'm dealing with an object of type array and { } tells me I 'm dealing with an object of type object literal ?

By using zero page addressing , only one byte is needed for the operand , so the instruction is shorter and , therefore , faster to execute than with addressing modes which take two operands . An example of a zero page instruction is AND $ 12.So if the operand 's argument is only one byte , should n't it appear directly after it , and be + 1 instead of + 2 ? Why +2 ?

Currently I chain promises by nesting and I want to return a promise to the caller . After reading the chaining section of Mozilla 's Using Promises guide , I 'm not sure if what I 'm doing is correct or equivalent to the `` callback pyramid of doom '' .Is there a cleaner way to do this ( besides chaining with a guard check in each then ) ? Am I right in my belief that in Mozilla 's example it will execute each chained then even when there is an error ?"

"Because javascript functions are not serializable , in order to pass them into new contexts sometimes ( albeit rarely ) it can be useful to stringify them then re-evaluate them later like : However , if foo references another function bar , the scope is not stringified , so if bar is not defined in the new context , the evaluated foo function will throw an error when called.I 'm wondering if there is a way to stringify a function recursively ? That is , not only stringifying the parent function , but also stringifying the contents of the child functions called from the parent.For Example : Let me know if you have any ideas on how to accomplish something like a `` recursiveToString ''"

I 'm trying to create a valid test case for the promiseRateLimit function below . The way the promiseRateLimit function works is it uses a queue to store incoming promises and will place a delay between them . Here 's an example of the function in action.The example promise takes 50ms to run and the promiseRateLimit function will only allow 1 promise every 100ms . So the interval between promises should be greater than 100ms . Here 's a complete test that sometimes returns successful and sometimes fails : I 've created a getIntervalsBetweenDates function that simply diff 's two unix timestamps and get the duration between an array of dates.The issue is that the test above sometimes returns an interval that is lower than the delay . For instance if the delay is 100ms sometimes an interval returns 98ms or 96ms . There is no reason this should ever happen.Is there any way to make the above test pass 100 % of the time ? I 'm trying to ensure that the delay argument works and that there is at least that much time between promises.Update 2016-12-28 9:20am ( EST ) Here 's the full testI 'm still getting the issue even with the example change .

"( Let us suppose that there is a good reason for wishing this . See the end of the question if you want to read the good reason . ) I would like to obtain the same result as a for in loop , but without using that language construct . By result I mean only an array of the property names ( I do n't need to reproduce the behavior that would happen if I modify the object while iterating over it ) .To put the question into code , I 'd like to implement this function without for in : From my understanding of the ECMAScript 5.1 specification about the for in statement and the Object.keys method , it seems the following implementation should be correct : The idea is to walk explicitly the prototype chain , and use Object.keys to get the own properties in each object of the chain . We exclude property names already seen in previous objects in the chain , including when they were seen as non-enumerable . This method should even respect the additional guarantee mentioned on MDN : The Object.keys ( ) method returns an array of a given object 's own enumerable properties , in the same order as that provided by a for ... in loop [ ... ] . ( emphasis is mine ) I played a bit with this implementation , and I have n't been able to break it.So the question : Is my analysis correct ? Or am I overlooking a detail of the spec that would make this implementation incorrect ? Do you know another way to do this , that would match the implementation 's specific order of for in in all cases ? Remarks : I do n't care about ECMAScript < 5.1.I do n't care about performance ( it can be disastrous ) .Edit : to satisfy @ lexicore 's curiosity ( but not really part of the question ) , the good reason is the following . I develop a compiler to JavaScript ( from Scala ) , and the for in language construct is not part of the things I want to support directly in the intermediate representation of my compiler . Instead , I have a `` built-in '' function getPropertiesOf which is basically what I show as first example . I 'm trying to get rid of as many builtins as possible by replacing them by `` user-space '' implementations ( written in Scala ) . For performance , I still have an optimizer that sometimes `` intrinsifies '' some methods , and in this case it would intrinsify getPropertiesOf with the efficient first implementation . But to make the intermediate representation sound , and work when the optimizer is disabled , I need a true implementation of the feature , no matter the performance cost , as long as it 's correct . And in this case I can not use for in , since my IR can not represent that construct ( but I can call arbitrary JavaScript functions on any objects , e.g. , Object.keys ) ."

"As far as I can tell , there are two main ways of creating functions for an object in javascript .

For clarity , we 'll call it method C , even though it does n't work for creating new objects with the new keyword.So , I would like to know what the differences between the two are . As far as I can tell they have the same effect logically , even if what 's happening on the machine is different.If I were to guess I would say that the only real difference is when you 're defining them in the constructor like in method A , it creates a whole new function object for each object that 's created , and Method B only keeps one copy of it ( in MyObject ) , that it refers to any time it 's called . if this is the case , why would you do it one way over the other .

My question is : Looking at the code samples below am I correct in my understanding or am I missing some information . Sample 1Need to instantiate the function ( or class ) in order to use the IsOld method , and a separate copy of the IsOld function will be created for each instance.Sample 2Need to instantiate but unlike MyClass1 the scripting engine will not need to create a copy of the method IsOld for each class instance.Sample 3No need to instantiate the function / class to access the IsOld method . A single instance of the IsOld method is used across all invocations . Note : I am guessing there are plenty of similar question / answers here on SO but for some reason I could not find one that actually made sense to me ."

"This question is about using Google Closure Compiler 's type annotations properly.We have a convention that every javascript file is wrapped in a function . Example file : Square.js : If we define a type ( such as a constructor ) inside this function , closure compiler is not aware of it in other files . For example , in another file : foo.js : Compiling it with -W VERBOSE gives an error that the type Square is not defined : We 've created externs for all our classes , in separate files , to work around this . Creating externs is a bad solution because now we have to maintain two files for every class.Is it possible to share the types if files are wrapped by a file-level function ?

"I 've grown used to code my jquery animation by doing the following.Set the initial state of the element ( things like width , height , top , left , opacity , etc ... ) using either css or javascript . This initial state is the state at the end of the animation.Use .animate with 0 duration to move the element to the state in which elements are at the beginning of the animation.Use a regular .animate with the appropriate duration to do the animation in which at the end , the elements are back to state in step 1.Here is an example.There are several advantage using this code at least for me . First , it looks clear to me what I 'm trying to animate . Second , if javascript is disabled , the object would be at the end state of the animation which is often where I want it to be for graceful degradation . Third , objects can change position slightly for adjustments using css and the animation would still look largely the same . The reason I 'm not using the .css is that it if I try to replace the animate with 0 duration with the .css method , I would get differing animation starting point .

When it 's created it changes the names of the files it access to the names in an Array so that I only have to change the list and add a file . The HTML it creates is a table so that I can insert the images with two columns.That table is then used for the selection menu as to which banner/curtain rod you 'd be selecting .

Now I need to have it so that when they 're clicked for selection , the sample image shown changes . Within the created HTML I created an onclick= '' select ( Insert Banner Name Here ) '' in an effort to have the banner info transfer over to the next function , which is a switch.I found out later that , from what I 've seen , the function transfers a variable and not the word/data itself . I 'm trying to think of a way I can code this so that , when called , the function knows what banner was clicked .

"The code : It 's from p. 367 of JavaScript : The Definitive Guide , 6th ed.Here 's what I think is happening in this code.The variable content is being assigned the result of a .map ( ) call on the NodeList of paragraph tags returned by document.getElementsByTagName ( `` p '' ) . The .map ( ) method is accessed from the Array.prototype , and its this value is set to be the paragraph tag NodeList using .call ( ) . Since .map ( ) applies a function that has access to item , index , array , the e in function ( e ) is the item of the NodeList . So the content variable ends up being comprised of the result of .innerHTML calls on each of the Element type Nodes in the NodeList made up of paragraph tags in the current document . .innerHTML will return the text of a given HTML element if it has no other nodes inside it . Otherwise it will return the HTML nodes inside it . Is that correct ?

"I 'm new to making chrome ( or even browser ) extensions am trying to make one that applies some custom CSS rules to certain page elements . It seems to work generally as expected , with a few slight annoyances.Namely , when I apply any CSS style rules using JS , there seems to be a delay between the page fully rendering in the browser to when my extension 's CSS rules are applied.One way I 've found to overcome this is to add the CSS file I want to be applied instantly to the manifest file , under the content_scripts , like so : But the issue now is that I want to check if the user has pressed the 'enable ' button on the pop up for my extension before applying this . To do this , in the filter.js and background scripts , I check the chrome storage etc . to see if the user has the enabled flag set to true.I then use the chrome.tabs.insertCSS method to insert my CSS file ( s ) .In the case where the user has pressed disable on the extension , the browser still renders the page with the effects of filter.css until it runs the JS to remove the effects . By the time this happens , the user has already seen the effects of filter.css which I do n't want.What I want is the browser to instantly apply or not apply my styles ( depending on if the user has enabled/disabled ) before the page is displayed to the user.The methods of injecting the CSS thus far have all led to a delay . It must be possible to add it in or remove the CSS without a delay , as I 've used extensions such as Dark Reader which seem to be able to apply their styles immediately without ever showing the browser content without their CSS.Ideally , there would be a way to do conditional checking in the manifest , but I know this is n't possible .

But the text , when the container becomes too small , the text of course just disappears . My intention is for the text to pinch too . What I 've triedSo of course I must use a transform . However a transform pinches the container visually , but does n't physically change the space that it inhabits , so the clicked list item does n't rise to the top . Finally , when I try to simultaneously transform a container and change its height to zero , the result is not as expected . The change in height is taken into account by the transformation , and also the text still just disappears at this point .

By default , I need 10 posts to display , then when a user scrolls to the bottom of the page , it will automatically load 10 more posts the user has written.Here is my infinity_scroll script : I need an if statement surrounding the alert ( ) which goes something like this - if the user has over 10 posts and the user has scrolled to the bottom , then display more data - Again for now , I am just using alert ( ) for testing . If the user has only made 2 posts for example , and the user scrolls to the bottom , the alert ( ) should not occur . My thinking is that I need a var which gets the number of posts for a user and then user that far to specify if conditions such as Is this the best way to go about this ? If not , what approach should I adopt ? Edit : How each single row ( single post ) is displayed :"

"An external API returns a JSON result of the following form : Here , the keys `` 1.0 '' , `` 2.3 '' , `` 3.6 '' should really be taken as strings denoting a discrete categorisation , not as values along a continuous axis .

I 've created a simple modal that is allowed to be closed when you click outside of the content area . This is by design but it has an unintended side-effect . If I click anywhere in the content area ( for example in a text field ) and drag the mouse to beyond the content area and then release the click it will close the modal . I often have a habit of doing this and I can see how average users will perceive this as a bug so I 'm trying to nip it prior to release.To test it properly : Click the 'Open the Modal ' button.Click in the text box at the center of the white panel.Enter some text.Press the left mouse button down in the text box.Drag the mouse beyond the bounds of the white panel.Release the mouse button.The modal should now be closed.Is there a way to prevent this without tracking the coordinates of the mouse ? Perhaps onmousedown instead of click ? That worked ! Just need more coffee this morning I suppose . Going to write up a thorough answer later today for future readers .

"So , I 've read the MDN disclaimers and warnings , I 've read a great answer on the subject , but there 's still something I want to know . This question actually came from an answer I gave to another question , here.Let 's say I decide to do the dirty deed . Something that I will regret for the rest of my life . Something that will stain me with shame forever and dishonor my family name . A purposeful , deliberate ending of -- Alright , enough of that . Anyway , here it is : Basically , what I did there , was change the prototype of Function.prototype , an object that impacts pretty much every piece of JavaScript code you could write . Then I changed it back.I wanted to illustrate a big change in the prototype chain that would impact a lot of code and cause a lot of optimizations to go down the drain . I do n't expect changing it back would fix anything ( if anything , I expect it would make things worse performance-wise ) . I 'd love to know if it would or would n't , but if it does , that was n't my intention.I just want to know if , after a change like this , will the JavaScript environment begin to recover and starting optimizing things again ? Or will it just give up forever and run everything in deoptimized mode ? Are there optimizations that will never be achieved because of this ? Can I trust that , eventually , after a period of recovery , it will return to its regular state ?

"This may seem like a weird question , but I do not really see many use cases for useEffect in React ( I am currently working on a several thousand-lines React codebase , and never used it once ) , and I think that there may be something I do not fully grasp.If you are writing a functional component , what difference does it make to put your `` effect '' code in a useEffect hook vs. simply executing it in the body of the functional component ( which is also executed on every render ) ? A typical use case would be fetching data when mounting a component : I see two approaches to this , one with useEffect and one without : Is there an advantage ( performance-wise or other ) to useEffect in such usecases ?"

"The facts : I have no jQuery experience or knowledge and this is my first ever question on Stack Overflow.The need : I 'm building a website using Bootstrap 3.3.6 with multiple , very complex data tables that have to be dynamically stacked on mobile devices via CSS . The column header has to be repeated otherwise the td values has no significance . Since the website is bilingual I want to have control over what the mobile td header says.The solution : a jQuery function that stores custom headers – entered via the title attribute in the first row th of each table – in an array , which it then adds via the CSS content property to each td in the tbody.The problem : the above function works well .. except when there are more than one table in a document . The function then applies the titles from the FIRST table to ALL tables in the document.What I want : 1 ) To give a unique id attribute to ONLY the tables that need to have the above function applied to . 2 ) Tables with no id attribute should be ignored . 3 ) The function then has to retrieve and apply the titles of each unique table to each respective table tbody . 4 ) I am concerned about this function possibly interfering with any other scripts , like Modernizr or prettyPhoto for example ?

"I 'm currently building a number heavy app in Knockout .

"I find that using the lifecycle method componentWillMount to setup initial state ... ... is slightly simpler than using the constructor . Namely because when you use the constructor you have to call super ( ) .Not only that but if your component is passed props and/or state then you have to manually pass those through as well.I have n't had any problems using componentWillMount but I virtually never see anyone using it for setting up state ( unless they are avoiding es6 and do n't have classes ) . I get that we have access to the constructor in an es6 class , but why use it when you have to wire a manual passthrough to the parent constructor and there is a perfectly good lifecycle method ready and waiting so you do n't have to do that ? Just curious if there was an actual practical reason or if it 's mostly just preference ."

Use case / work aroundI 'm curious if it is possible to do something like I 've explained above . However , due to my use case it is not a blocking issue since I can use Coffeescript 's super call to work around it by making it a function.I 'm currently using Backbone and I have two classes . One inherits from Backbone.Model and the other inherits from the first class . In the first class I 'm setting the defaults property so that when this model is created , it has instance variables set if they 're not passed in . The class inheriting from my first class has one additional key value pair to add to this defaults object though it would be the same situation if I wanted to overwrite a default.The object 's default values in Backbone are obtained by using Underscore 's result method so the quick work around in this case is to simply make defaults a function that returns the same object . In Coffeescript this is incredibly easy and becomes : And then in Bar you can do the following :"

Imagine we define a new object like this : This should define a new `` Hidden Class '' with these two properties.Now imagine I define a new class using ES6 class syntax.and I create a new object from it.Now the question : Is the `` Hidden Class '' of the bar going to be the same as the Hidden Class of foo ? Because what I imagine is going on is that the first definition will create a new `` Hidden Class '' with two properties but the second will create a new `` Hidden Class '' then it will create a new `` Hidden Class '' with one property and then create yet another `` Hidden Class '' with yet another property resulting in three `` Hidden Classes '' linked together.Can somebody clarify that ? If my assumptions are right then the new `` ES6 class syntax '' is indeed slower.Based on the article : JavaScript engine fundamentals : Shapes and Inline Caches · Mathias Bynens

"I am writing a mobile application using Phonegap/Cordova.The mobile application needs information from a server-side application , which I have written . I created an API to get this information.One of the first things the API does is verify the mobile application is an application which I have written.It does this using a public API key and a secret API key . ( They are used in generating the authorization header ) .The authorization header is generated on the mobile application and on the server-side application and the server will check them against eachother for discrepancies.It goes something like this : Mobile Application ( Javascript/jQuery ) Server Side ( PHP ) The problem obviously lies in the fact that I need the secret API key to generate the signature on the client side.After reading articles online , a lot of people have said to store the secret on the server ( then use the server as an intermediary ) , but I believe that only applies if you 're using a third party API.This also just moves the problem away from the client . What stops somebody from just making a call to the intermediary , which will just stick the secret on anyway ? A very similar solution is to store the secret on the server and fetch it when the app loads , but surely that 's the same problem ... what 's stopping somebody from simply going to api.mydomain.com/getsecretkey ? Storing secrets on the client is just not viable . Especially with phonegap . So how do people do it ? Any and all help is appreciated ."

I recently read the react.js documentation and found inconsistencies in setting the state based on previous state value .

"I 'm more of a back-end guy than a front-end guy , but JavaScript intrigues me .

I also flipped through a few of these slides : http : //ejohn.org/apps/learn/ # 65 , which was also helpful . It turns out that all I had to do was create an instance of TicketForm , at which time it 's methods became available to me : I have three questions : Why , aside from personal coding style , would one choose either one of the methods above over the other ? Why do I have to declare an instance of the object with the second method , while I do n't with the first ? Are there proper names for either of these coding styles ?"

"I 'm making a jQuery plugin that displays alerts on the page . The plugin itself inserts the alert markup into the DOM . Since the jQuery way is to make everything return this to maintain chaining , I 've run into an interesting issue I 'd like feedback on .

The problem is that it 's unclear what is returned . It would make sense to return the alert element that was just created , but that kind of goes against the jQuery way.Option Two : This way seems less clear and less intuitive , but it 's more inline with the jQuery way of doing things , and it 's clear what element is going to be returned.So which options would you choose ?

The firstthree arguments are iterables of ‘ waitable objects ’ : either integersrepresenting file descriptors or objects with a parameterless methodnamed fileno ( ) returning such an integer : rlist : wait until ready for readingwlist : wait until ready for writingxlist : wait for an “ exceptional condition ” ( see the manual page forwhat your system considers such a condition ) Seeing that the feature is based on the Unix system call , I realized this code might not support Windows , which is my environment . I checked the values of rlist , wlist , xlist and found they 're all empty lists on the first iteration rList = [ 784 ] ( or another number , such as 664 ) and the other two are empty , after which the connection is closed.The documentation goes on to note : Note : File objects on Windows are not acceptable , but sockets are . On Windows , the underlying select ( ) function is provided by theWinSock library , and does not handle file descriptors that don ’ toriginate from WinSock.But I 'm not clear on the exact meaning of this.So in the code logic , I did some logging and traced the issue here : And as to why client.recv ( 1024 ) returns an empty binary string , I have no idea .

"Common advice is to keep your CSS and JS files external . The reason : What you lose in the additional HTTP request* , you often gain back by not having to download cacheable static content ( which CSS and JS usually is ) .However , the smaller your external file , the more penalizing the additional HTTP request -- even if it is a 304 Not Modified response . So the smaller the external file , the more reason to favor inlining your CSS and JS content , at least when speed is your primary concern.I ran some tests . Without going through the details , my results look like this : My general conclusion is that using external files does n't really matter until they get BIG . And by BIG , I mean the 50-100KB range ... And that 's minified and gzipped , if you take advantage of those.Can anyone confirm or refute these results with additional data ?

"The usual way of adding Javascript to a page is by adding it to the document 's < body > or < head > in either static HTML or something generated server-side.I would like to generate dynamic Javascript , and add it to the document in a dynamic fashion ; that is on-demand and during run-time . For example Javascript code transmitted over a WebSocket.One option is to create a script element , add the string with script contents to the .text property , while finally adding the script to the document , like this : This would work , but my concern is that the script is executed with the same URL/origin as the HTML document . Whereas , if it would be a separate file , invoked with the s.src parameter , it would show up under its own URL when looking at the browser console.Why is this at all relevant ? When using the browser console to debug and inspect , it usually tells you the name of the script and the line/column of the message printed to the console . For example , when opening the console , one might several console messages , with on the right side the origin and line/column information : This is the behavior that I desire because it makes it easy to distinguish what script has written something to the console . However , if adding Javascript dynamically to the page , it all gets 'advertised ' under the main document , usually printed by the domainname , like domain.com:1:1.What I would like is to change/pretend/masquerade the origin of the script , to pretend it was an external script . This way , not all lines printed to the console would be from origin domain.com : < line > : < column > but instead would be called specifically , like module1 : < line > : < column > .Is this at all possible ?"

"PROBLEM : R Shiny – Make wellPanel pop-up follow as you scroll with CSSHi Stack Users , I 've created a Shiny application that has a data table wherein when a user clicks on a row , a hidden wellPanel will pop-up beside it to show more details related to that row.The length of the pop-up wellPanel is long but the length of the table is longer ( row count non-negotiable ) .

For all I know , I could be doing something stupid . Is this `` best practice '' , or would that be something very different ?"

"I have two instances of an object that extends EventEmitter and listens to an event called finish . If I set the event handler outside the constructor everything works as expected . Each instance hears the occurence of finish that it triggers . But if I set the event handler inside the constructor , only the instance created second hears and reacts to the event , or so it seems.Here is the code : Notice that the LISTENER ID for the version of the event handler that is set up within the constructor of MyEmitter always belongs to the second created instance , making it seem that that instance is always catching the event first , and for some reason the first created instance never has that handler triggered.Two facts that I am assuming I understand correctly : this in the event handler should always be the object that emitted the event.this in the constructor should always be the object to be returned by the constructor ( because it is called with new ) .If both of these are true I do n't know what else I am not understanding that results in the exhibited behavior.One other thing this made me think about : Should an event always be `` heard '' by the same EventEmitter that emitted the event ? That is what I thought and certainly that seems to be the most common use case . But if that is not a restriction then how , for example , does a click event on a button not trigger the click handlers for all the other buttons ?"

"In Javascript , almost all expressions ( all expressions ? ) have a `` truthiness '' value . If you put an expression in a statement that expects a boolean , it will evaluate to a boolean equivalent .

"Imagine a React page that allows users to edit a bill ( invoice ) . The bill has a fair number of editable fields , say 100 . Additionally , a bill can have any number of line items .

"Background explanationI have asked a question concerning defining an date array using a loop . The array is defined on basis of a declared variable named `` dateinterval '' . The way I designed the code resulted in an error message in relation to another loop and another user provided another loop for me which solved this.Now that I have closely compared the two different solutions I simply do not understand why they do not produce the same outcome.My codeI developed the below code to define an array of dates in UTC format . However the outcome is an array of dates in millisecs since January 1 , 1970 , 00:00:00 . So in other words a number.The proper solutionThe below code is the proper one provided to me by another user ( thank you again ! ) This code defines an array of UTC dates.What I do n't understandI have almost become blind from staring at the two different solutions to figure out what the difference is and I just do n't get it . To my untrained eyes it seems that the two pieces of code perform exactly the same operation and that the only difference is how they are structured . I have been informed that setDate returns millisecs and that in my code these millisecs were assigned to the array . But in the proper solution the variable DT is also assigned a setDate value which - as I understand it - should also be in millisecs . So why does the line : not assign millisecs to the dateinterval array ? Can anyone explain this to me so that I can better understand Javascript and not just replicate working solutions ?"

Then I tried to modify the class 's constructor , which paired with an array of all the relevant classes could be done dynamically , however changing a class 's constructor does not seem to be possible , as I triedTemporarily , I pivoted to trying to define my object as a function , but that ran into the problem of accessing the names of the function parameters , and that 's apparently only possible via Regexing the source code , which I 'd rather avoid. -- -- -PS : -- -- -- -I have made somewhat of a breakthrough , managing to pass the child keys to the parent , by having the parent construct a copy of the child , but truncate the recursion there , like so : However , it appears something else has broken , because it still does not assign the values to the resulting object. -- -- -END PS -- -- -- -- -So , to conclude : Is it possible in Javascript to assign a constructor like this dynamically , and if not , is there another way of creating objects with trivial constructors like this ?

The same goes for vertical.The script is vanilla JavaScript and the piece where the error seems to occur is here : One weird thing to also note , is that the displacement is n't just occurring for one bubble at a time , but for all bubbles within short periods of time.The bug occurs in all major browsers.All input is appreciated !"

"I 'm reviewing ECMAScript 5.1 Specification kinda seriously.And I 'm curious if there is a way to tell what the `` real constructor function '' of an object in ES5 . ( not the explicit `` constructor '' property ) According to the spec , explicit `` constructor '' property is just a initial back-reference from the byproduct object of a function object to the function object . ( Here , the byproduct is the object which is initially pointed by the function object 's explicit `` prototype '' property . ) So , explicit `` constructor '' property has nothing to do with the real constructor of an object : Here , even though foo2 was created by Foo , since Foo.prototype was pointing to bar at the moment of creation of foo2 , so foo2 's internal [ [ Prototype ] ] gets to point to bar , and we can check this by : Since foo2 does n't have own `` constructor '' property as usual , so , reading foo2.constructor is actually [ [ Prototype ] ] chain lookup , that is , foo2.constructor -- > ( ( foo2 . [ [ Prototype ] ] ) ) .constructor -- > bar.constructor which is Object , not Foo.You can check this by : Finally , is there no way to find Foo from the object foo2 ? ADD : I 'm talking about ES5 .

Since we 're going to be setting Employee.protoype as Manager 's prototype , what 's the need for ( as I see it ) explicitly forcing the creation of variables in Employee through call ( ) ? Earlier I thought that it might be because no object of Employee exists , and JS inheritance ca n't work without objects , so call ( ) here served to `` complete the object build '' . But then , the type property gets reflected in Manager without the need for call ( ) , which proves that we do n't need a hard object to perform inheritance ( what I mean is , just the class-like constructor function definition will do ) .I hope I have n't made it too complicated .

"This question is related to mine and explains what .data method is in Jquery.Apart from the relation to HTML5 data-* element attributes ( like < p class='foo_cl ' data-bar='gee ' > , for example ) why would I code : instead of ( I am mostly interested in the case where the Jquery selector gives one object , like for $ ( 'body ' ) above ) The later ( §2 ) seems more readable and shorter , and I guess would be more efficient , than the former ( §1 ) . Of course data is a Jquery selector ( but I could use each to set the .my_lab field , etc ... ) And I might even consider changing the DOM element with the ugly looking ( which is perhaps undefined behavior , see this ) Of course , there is the potential issue of colliding the field name my_lab with some existing field in JQuery implementation ; but I assume that using some common suffix ( like my_ ) in field names should be enough.FWIW , I am only interested in recent Jquery ( e.g . Jquery 2.1.4 ) on recent Firefox ( e.g . 38 or 42 ) on Linux.In other words , why would adding my own fields in JQuery objects be frowned upon ?"

"TLDR : Why are function parameters not treated as var declarations ? Using var , redeclaring a variable declared using var has no effect . The original declaration remains in effect.However , using var in this way will mask a parameter of the same name . Why is the language designed like this ? In the following , variable var bar is treated as a new declaration and not a redeclaration of parameter bar.Is it designed like this because arguments and local variables are semantically fundamentally different , and fall into two categories ?

"As RIAs and SPAs ( or web apps with heavy javascript usage ) have become more and more popular , I 've been running into systems that , instead of using good old a href hyperlinks , I see them utilizing constructs using onclick with JavaScript code that manipulates navigation . This is particularly true with images.For example , instead of seeing something like this : What is the advantage of this ? It makes it incredibly hard to trace where pages transition to when debugging or trying to root cause a bug . I can get the idea when the target to navigate can change ( so yes , here you could use a function that computes to what page to navigate to . ) But I see this pattern even when the pages to navigate to are constant . I find this extremely convoluted and hard to test . Not to mention that there is always the browser-specific bugs that come from stuff ( sadly in my experience from over-complexifying the front-end . ) But I am not a RIA/SPA developer ( just backend and traditional web development ) . Am I missing the rationale behind this ? TO CLARIFYMy question is not for the case when we want to redraw the page or change current content without changing the current location . My question is for plainold transitions , from page A to page B.In such a case , why use onclick=funcToChangeLocation ( ) over < a href= '' some location '' / > .This has been a pain for me when troubleshooting systems that are already written ( for I would n't write them like that ) , but there could be reasons I am not aware of.Again , my question is not for pages that redraw themselves without changing the browser location , but for navigation from one page to the next.ALSOIf you are going to vote to close this question , at least leave a message explaining why ."

"I am reading `` The JavaScript Handbook '' by Flavio Scopes . He introduces the concept of Generators.Output { value : 5 , done : false } Output : { value : 14 , done : false } I understand the first output , but I do n't understand the second one . Why is the output 14 ? My understanding is that the next time .next ( ) is called on calc , it should continue on the line AFTER the one on which it last paused.Well , that line is this one : var another = yield ( doubleThat ) and the value of the variable doubleThat at that point should be 10 , so I 'm expecting the second yield to return an object with a value of 10.I do n't think the example in the book is a good one , as I understand the concept of Generators ( Python ) and Iterators ( C++/Python ) , and I understand other Javascript examples of Generators - but I simply do not understand what is going on here.Can anyone explain why the value returned after calc.next ( 7 ) is 14 ?"

"I recently read this article tries to explain how JavaScript 's ability to manipulate functions could be used to let every computer in the world to do a small part in processing all the information on the internet . The way I understand it is this : the function map allows you to call a function to every element in an array quicklyand JS allows you to call a function without declaring it . The premise is that if all data on the internet was stored as an array you can ( somehow using map ) split the task of making some specific change to every item in the array between several CPUs or all the computers of the world.This is the part I do not understand - why do you need map or JS 's array manipulation to do this ? Could n't you just send every computer a section of the array , send them the function to run on every element in the array , and have them convert the array without needing to execute map or any number of wacky function usage ? Sure , using a function as an object seems convenient , but why is this at all integral to the task of splitting tasks between CPUs ?"

"This problem occurs only if the state value was actually changed due to the previous update.In the following example , when the button is clicked for the first time , `` setState '' is called with a new value ( of 12 ) , and a component update occurs , which is understandable.When I click the same button for the second time , setting the state to the same value of 12 it causes the component to re-run ( re-render ) , and why exactly that happens is my main question.Any subsequent setStates to the same value of 12 will not trigger a component update , which is again , understandable . 12 === 12 so no update is needed.So , why is the update happening on the second click of the button ?

So I try to increase artificially the height with code such asJSFiddle ( note that you must resize the `` Result '' pane so that it is small enough for the table to hide the button ) but I have run into issues.The first issue is that I would much prefer do this declaratively .

Lastly , all this resides in an angular project , and window.ready does n't seem to always trigger properly.What am I doing wrong ?"

"According to the section 3.8.3 in the book Javascript the Definitive Guide 6th edition : To convert an object to a string , JavaScript takes these steps : • If the object has a toString ( ) method , JavaScript calls it . If it returns a primitive value , JavaScript converts that value to a string ( if it is not already a string ) and returns the result of that conversion . Note that primitive-to-string conversions are all well-defined in Table 3-2 . • If the object has no toString ( ) method , or if that method does not return a primitive value , then JavaScript looks for a valueOf ( ) method . If the method exists , JavaScript calls it . If the return value is a primitive , JavaScript converts that value to a string ( if it is not already ) and returns the converted value . • Otherwise , JavaScript can not obtain a primitive value from either toString ( ) or valueOf ( ) , so it throws a TypeError.For example : Accordingly , the code snippet above will convert obj to string because of obj + `` , so it should print : But actually , it prints : So what 's wrong ? Does n't obj + `` convert obj to string ?"

"I 'm trying out a simple CSRF attack and ran into an issue.If I have a dummy site containing this form : My original idea was to have this form `` self submitting '' by having a script tag call submit on the form on page load to automatically change the user 's password when they visit the page : This looked like it worked , but the password failed to change . When looking at the GET parameters , I realized that it was because it did n't include the Change parameter ( the submit button itself ) . It produced : Instead of : And I 'm guessing this is causing it to fail a validation check on the backend.It seemed hacky , but I was able to fix it by having it click the submit button instead of submiting the form directly : I looked over the relevant MDN page , and it notes that calling submit has two differences from clicking the submit button : No submit event is raised .

If you take a look at the code below , you can see that every menu item is contained within the < li > tag . Now , you can also see that the description start off with the display : none ; property . What I am trying to do is this : Using Javascript ( I do n't think it 's possible with plain HTML and CSS ) , how can I set the style of the description to display : block ; of that particular item when either the `` title '' class or the `` svg-container '' class is called ? In either case , when the svg or the title is pressed , the svg MUST rotate 90 degrees and return to 0 degrees when it 's clicked again . The problem is that I do n't know how to get the reference of the exact item that has been pressed so I can show it 's description ... This is a visual representation of what the menu looks like for now : And this is why I need the description to be set to display : block ; I tried my best to explain the problem in a clear way , for any questions or uncertainties I am here to answer . Thanks in advance ! EDIT : Thanks everyone for the quick help , but after implementing your code , there is a slight problem , look what happens when the title is too long to fit inside the menu div : As you can see , the title moves completely on a new line , but what it should just move the content that does n't fit ( WITHOUT splitting the word , only if there is a space ) on the new line ."
"I have recently been working on a comment feature . By default , the height of the paragraph element containing the text is 80px . Overflow is set to hidden.I have another button ( labelled `` See More '' ) that expands the paragraph by changing height to 'auto ' . This button should only be visible if the paragraph content is overflowing the default 80px height . Otherwise the button must not be displayed.I have tried to do this with a javascript for loop and some JQuery code , though it does n't work as it should . It shows or hides the button for all comment sections.Here is the html : Here is the JavaScript : Thanks for taking the time to read . Any help would be appreciated ."

"I 'm having issues using external resources in a Puppeteer job that I 'm running with a full Chrome executable ( not the default Chromium ) . Any help would be massively appreciated ! So for example , if I load a video with a public URL it fails even though it works fine if I hit it manually in the browser.Here 's my Puppeteer call : Unlike many Puppeteer examples , the issue here is n't that my test does n't wait long enough . The resources fail to load / return empty responses almost instantly.It also does n't appear to be an authentication issue - I reach my own server just fine.Although I 'm not running on https here , the URL I try directly in the browser works without SSL.I should also mention that this is a React ( CRA ) website and I 'm calling Puppeteer with Node.I can see that at least 3 other external resources ( non-video ) also fail . Is there a flag or something I should be using that I 'm missing ? Thanks so much for any help !"

After a very long search i have found this strange behaviour : See fiddle : https : //jsfiddle.net/723xhcrf/When you create an element with params the width and height ( maybe more ) are added to the style argument like so : GivesBut when you already have a style something strange happens based on the order of the keys of the params object.givesAndgivesWhat you see here is that the first width or height ( maybe more ) are overwritten by the style attribute that comes after it . I expect that both width and height in both cases are appended to the style attribute.So my solution is to have a function that orders the params so that the style param is always the first key in the params object.Does anyone know if this behavior is wanted or is this a bug in the jquery creation of dom elements ?
